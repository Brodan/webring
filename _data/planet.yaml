    I’ve been following a mental thread that has me exploring the idea of <em>planned
    economies</em>. If you’ve never heard of it before, strap on your economics hat
    and get ready for a wild ride. The high-level idea behind them is to allocate
    scarce resources according to a set of society or community level goals. These
    goals can be anything from pointing everything at building machinery for protecting
    oneself during a war<sup id=\"fnref:0\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:0\"
    class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> to transitioning to a sustainable

    to a planned economy</a> during WWII when it became apparent that private companies
    couldn’t be trusted to manufacture the materials necessary for sustaining the

    Colombia that Mapy planned! We started with a bowl full of frozen ants and had
    to remove the head (because the pincers will still cut you), legs, and wings.
    Then, we fried them on some traditional ceramic cookware from the region. We tasted
    a few when they were rare, medium-rare, and well done.</p><p>Certainty, an experience
    I'll never forget. The smells and tastes were so fun. I loved seeing Mapy's reactions
    as she got out of her comfort zone. The woman who taught the workshop was part
    of a collective commune and told us how she's been building community with it
    and elevating people. It was all so fun and brought me a lot of joy, and I hope
    I can do it again one day.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1704472221964/0fe1c7da-d700-41cd-8253-1fffd18e993e.jpeg\"

    as roaming and paid communications to and internationally or DROM-COM.</p></blockquote><p>Oops,
    I didn''t realize that would stop my roaming data from working right away...</p><p>When
    I got back on wifi I turned off that setting, rebooted, turned off my phone, waited
    a few hours, changed APN settings (I use <a target="_blank" href="https://support-pro.free.fr/configurer-manuellement-le-reseau-mobile-serveur-sms-mms-apn-et-acces-internet/">these</a>),

  title: Cancelling Vienna's Annual Pass Early
  url: https://blog.rayberger.org/cancelling-viennas-annual-pass-early
  fellow: *2
  description: <p>I'm writing this blog post about canceling my <a target="_blank"
    href="https://www.wienerlinien.at/web/wl-en/annual-pass">Weiner Linen annual pass</a>
    with the hope it saves someone a little hassle.</p><p>This blog post was written
    in October 2023 but this happened back in July.</p><p>When I moved to Vienna I
    wasn't eligible for the public transit student card because I was older than 25.
    The next cheapest option for riding daily is the annual ticket. Unfortunately,
    I was only staying in Vienna for a year so I just gotta cancel the ticket early
    to get a partial refund.</p><p>"Just" is the keyword here. When I ordered the
    annual pass the physical card never came in the mail but since I had it in my
    phone I didn't request a replacement.</p><h2 id="heading-cancelling">Cancelling</h2><p>As
    the date of my move out got closer I researched how to cancel the annual pass.
    Turns out you need to go to one of a few physical locations. My friend went to
    one location and said they were unhelpful and recommended I go to <a target="_blank"
    href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/rZ8PY3Q1bDUC92Co9">this one</a> and be done in five
    minutes.</p><p>When I arrived they told me that since I don't have the physical
    card I have to file a lost request form, print it out, and bring it back. I asked
    them if it was possible to fill out the form at the counter. They insisted they
    couldn't print it and that it was not possible to do it with them because <a target="_blank"
    href="https://www.fundamt.gv.at/WebPublic/">the form</a> was too complicated and
    not available in English. They recommended going to a print shop but that wasn't
    an option before they closed. Turns out the form didn't take 5 minutes to fill
    out using Google Translate and only asked basic questions.</p><p>That day was
    my last day in the city that they were open and there wasn't time so I asked if
    a friend could do it.</p><p>They said my friend needs to bring:</p><ul><li><p>A
    special doc (which they gave to me) that authorizes someone to act in your behalf</p></li><li><p>A
    printed copy of my ID</p></li><li><p>The report of the lost card</p></li><li><p>Maybe
    money to pay the lost card fee (turns out they never asked)</p></li></ul><p>My
    friend brought these and <strong>canceled my card without a problem</strong>.
    However, she did mention that they were annoyed that the address I put on the
    form for the lost card didn't match the address in my account (since I moved after
    opening my account).</p><p>There you have it. Canceling the card isn't so bad
    and well worth the cost savings. But if you don't have the physical card just
    fill out the form ahead of time. Unfortunately, this info didn't seem easy to
    find online and even when I called them they couldn't tell me what the form to
    fill was. After publishing this blog Vienna started offering the "digital-only
    annual pass" so hopefully this won't be an issue for anyone else!</p>

    as the devs were fast and helpful in responding to my PRs despite being under
    a huge workload as they surged in popularity. I like Lemmy because it is easy
    to set up and hard to censor (due to being federated). I look forward to seeing
    how the fediverse will grow with platforms like Lemmy and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ernestwisniewski/kbin">kbin</a>

    of Lemmy has <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/dessalines/essays/blob/master/socialism_faq.md">some
    political views</a> that I dont agree with. However, Lemmy is still contributing
    to the greater good and inherently designed so people can spin up a new instance
    if they have different opinions so Im happy I was able to contribute in my small

  description: '<p><a target="_blank" href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865847/redteamblues"><em>Red
    Team Blues</em></a> is the first book in a new series by <a target="_blank" href="https://craphound.com/">Cory
    Doctorow</a>. In the near future, a retired forensic accountant, Martin Hench
    takes on one final job for an old friend. What follows is an unconventional who-done-it,
    featuring romance, gang warfare, philosophical ponderings, twists and turns, and
    problems with no clear solution. The title is a play on the words <a target="_blank"
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team">Red Team</a>, which is the attackers
    in security, and Blues which is to be sad but also ironic because the red team
    is usually pitted against the blue team.</p><p>I love how Doctorow makes Martin
    Hench, the 67-year-old retired accountant, relatable and have a thrilling story
    as he tries to navigate a world of opportunities to give up his morals and take
    the easy path. The books critiques of surveillance and Martins balanced approach
    to securing his activities inspire me to fight for a world where we dont have
    to jump through so many hoops for some privacy.</p><p>Although the book contains
    some pretty gruesome descriptions of hurt people, those dont dominate the story
    and are well balanced by the romantic and adventure parts. I listened to <a target="_blank"
    href="https://libro.fm/audiobooks/5184389278339-red-team-blues">the audiobook</a>,
    narrated by <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wil_Wheaton">Wil
    Wheaton</a>, which is so well acted it intensified all of the ups and downs.</p><p>My
    only real complaint about this book (but hey you cant do it all) was the ending.
    The book clearly has some strong moral messages about problems (like surveillance)
    and how we can avoid them long term. However, at the end of the book (small spoiler
    here), the character simply donates a large amount of money to an organization
    helping homeless people. For all the big ideas this book puts out Im a bit disappointed
    it didnt touch more on the root causes of homelessness (property speculation,
    weak tenant protections, inaccessible healthcare, etc) which arent addressed by
    homeless shelters. Perhaps thats saved for one of the next books in the series
    ;)</p><p>In short, I loved this book and would recommend it to anyone looking
    for a short, exciting, and educational story. Im quite excited for the next book
    in the series <em>The Bezzle,</em> which is just one of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doctorow/red-team-blues-another-audiobook-that-amazon-wont-sell/posts/3861247">many</a>
    books Doctorow has coming down the pipeline.</p><p>Disclaimer: Doctorow offered
    to add your name to the end of the next book if you write a review and send it
    to him. Thats a partial motivation for writing this but I already paid for the
    book before I knew about that offer.</p>'

  title: Migrating Between Matrix (Element) Accounts for Beeper
  url: https://blog.rayberger.org/migrating-matrix-accounts
  fellow: *2
  description: "<p>I was recently invited to Beeper (one chat app for fb/insta/discord/linkedin/etc).
    It has definitely helped me stay up-to-date with replying to friends across different
    chat apps as I can now see them all in one place.</p><p>Beeper doesnt let you
    connect a Matrix account (yet). Which kinda makes sense since Beeper gives you
    a Matrix account when you sign up. Since Ive been enjoying Beeper so much I decided
    to try to move a few chats from my main Matrix account to there.</p><p>I <a target=\"_blank\"
    href=\"http://kagi.com/\">Kagid</a> around a bit and didnt see too much about
    how one should migrate accounts. I did see <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ems.element.io/tools/matrix-migration\">this
    tool</a> to do it for you. However, the tool says This is a labs feature and should
    be used with caution and I dont want to share my credentials to see how well it
    works. It does say this though:</p><blockquote><p>Migration is performed by logging
    in on behalf of your old and new accounts and automatically inviting your new
    account in to all of the rooms that your old account is in. You can optionally
    request that your old user leaves rooms once the new user has successfully joined.</p></blockquote><p>I
    decided to try it for myself manually. First, I created a chat between my Beeper
    and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://Matrix.org\">Matrix.org</a> accounts. Then
    I added my Beeper account to a 1:1 chat with a friend.</p><h1 id=\"heading-decrypting-messages\">Decrypting
    Messages</h1><p>Unfortunately, thats where I hit my first snag, the <a target=\"_blank\"
    href=\"https://github.com/vector-im/element-meta/issues/245\">dreaded</a> error
    message:</p><blockquote><p>Unable to decrypt: The sender's device has not sent
    us the keys for this message.</p></blockquote><p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/TnhlK6A7dbjDQfi6q4sXRCA2mojUR8-M1v6GMh5ULA1ONnAbim80E9Sm7g2IN46zMd-rFIqnlGYFSx_gjYv96R7z_3q41EdVKA-IJIWer_GMpscLTx1hPhZJiTV9t_blI6kvQUMIvVjaEU9Zyj5CYkA\"
    alt=\"Screenshot of Beeper chat with previously metioned error message.\" /></p><p>It
    was showing this for messages from my Matrix account and from my friend. I waited
    a while. I clicked the force sync button. I didnt see any request on my other
    devices to send keys. I found <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/vector-im/element-meta/issues/245\">this</a>
    relatively recent (2023) meta issue about encryption issues and how theyre being
    addressed by the Element R (rust) crypto library being rolled out. This tells
    me it is still an issue. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://blog.neko.dev/posts/unable-to-decrypt-matrix.html\">blog
    post</a> linked in the thread gave me the idea to poke around in my settings and
    see what I can find. I verified the session between my two accounts but it didn't
    help. I kept digging around.</p><p>Lo and behold: theres an option to Import and
    Export E2E room keys. It seemed like it might help and it couldnt hurt so I went
    ahead and exported the keys from my Matrix account and imported them into my Beeper
    account. Voil, now all the messages are decrypted! \U0001F44F</p><p>I added my
    Beeper account to a big (10+) E2E group chat. The same issue happened, but over
    a few minutes some of the messages showed up from people who were online but most
    remained encrypted. I once again imported the same keys to Beeper and boom, all
    the messages were readable. Awesome!</p><h1 id=\"heading-making-accounts-admin\">Making
    Accounts Admin</h1><p>One other issue, I want to make my Beeper account Admin
    in these rooms. I click Room Info -&gt; People -&gt; My Beeper account but dont
    see any option to make someone else an admin. I just see these options:</p><p><img
    src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/HgHKvRsKGFjqus6uShfzp7bmnWrBvpayApctioX8VUOMjjfVO76nKDHE0kvA9gpCEqNqDVgYq-ixHcOQXo7RjxJjxOd1FUqqYNcBNVFjKqDjQ-6vxDEcFxQj6Dw3Ys8IXkx68hjVUnkj1uULu4LOEz8\"
    alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p><p>Confused, I google How to make someone
    a room admin in Matrix and similar phrases but dont come up with anything. After
    a while, I figured out to click setting on the room and then under Role &amp;
    Permissions you can add someone as admin. Its a bit tucked away, and definitely
    room for improvement with the Element clients but it worked like a charm.</p><h1
    id=\"heading-summary\">Summary</h1><p>The migration was a bit annoying, but overall
    Im happy that it was relatively easy to migrate accounts and that, with a little
    polish, the process should be no problem in the future.</p><p>On a side note:
    I do worry about completely relying on Beeper for my Matrix chats. They are a
    VC-backed company that may not be around too long. However, theyve built a great
    experience that Im willing to pay for when the time comes so Ill enjoy it while
    it lasts. Oh, also it sucks that Beeper <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack\">MITM</a>
    all your messages but the end UX is nice enough to justify it for now.</p><p>PS:
    Someone should make a video demo of the Matrix migration tool so people can see
    how it works. Specifically, does it move all your chats or let you select which
    ones to move? Does it handle the keys issue I had to deal with manually?</p>"

    learned to use <a target="_blank" href="https://maptionnaire.com/">Maptionnaire</a>
    and did an informal survey of our classmates. Afterward, we had the chance to
    analyze the data however we wanted. Most people used Maptionnaire''s great built-in

    survey asked "Where did you cry in Brussels?" and "How many tears did you cry?"

    of how much they cried. So I decided to use my programming skills to try to do

    <content base="http://liaokev.in/2023/05/21/baptism-statement.html"
      type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On May 21st in 2023, with friends and family joining in-person and online at Alameda State Beach in California, I was baptized. I was asked to share a testimony beforehand, so here’s what I shared. My sincerest gratitude to everyone who took time out of their busy lives to join in, whether it was online or in-person. This is a day I’ll cherish forever.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://liaokev.in/assets/2023/5/21/banner.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cover&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I left the church on a spring day in the 10th grade when my youth pastor told us that non-Christians can’t love. A little voice told me that didn’t make sense. So I listened to that little voice. I walked out of that church and I didn’t look back.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I have trepidation about baptism, as if this act today washes away the sin of many organizations that continue to explicitly preach, or implicitly condone blatant misogyny, homophobia and transphobia in the name of Christ. It does not. A better church can only come from breaking the wall of silence that we were all brought up to uphold. Our faith is too wide and our God too mighty to be interpreted in such a narrow and harmful way.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Years before I even knew that I could use the word bisexual to describe myself, my faith had a predestined identity chosen for me. When I left the church, I thought I would never return. However, at the same time, it was through this church, OakLife, that I first found queer community and belonging. God speaks and moves in contradictions in ways I’m still wrestling with.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Baptism and by-proxy the Christian faith is centered around death and resurrection. We do seem to like to talk about death as a faith tradition an awful lot, so it seems somewhat morbidly befitting to ponder about death. Today, I want to talk about the life and death of the most Christlike man that I know, my grandpa, or Ah Gong- who was not a follower of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;My earliest memories of my Ah Gong were as a toddler growing up in Australia. He had come down from Taiwan and I didn’t know why. My ah gong and ah ma were like extra parents, helping my mother around the house as she adjusted to life in a strange country. The spirit of our house was lifted as ah gong would sneak us M&amp;amp;Ms and cook us fried rice. We’d sit on his lap and he’d teach us nursery rhymes.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As an adult I learned that Ah Gong and Ah Ma were a mere months away from a generous lifetime pension that they forfeited to come down to care for my mother, who had just given birth to my sister. As they handed in their letters of resignation, their supervisor was astounded. The pension they were forfeiting was the salary of six employees. But a voice that I would call the holy spirit, the voice that compels acts of sacrificial love, commanded them to go, so they left.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When Ah Gong died, a question I’d been confronting since I was a child took on a new and sudden urgency. What happens when someone you love dies without believing? I didn’t have an answer and was filled with the same rage and resentment that I had felt as a kid when my faith seemingly had no answers for those who didn’t believe.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I looked for answers everywhere. Leaving the church gave me freedom to start taking part in Taiwanese traditions that form the basis for how we conceptualize death. I’d like to share a couple of unorganized thoughts about these traditions today, in hopes that with enough corn starch they will congeal together to form something vaguely resembling a statement of faith.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I started burning paper money. During “Ghost Month” in Taiwan, the streets are filled with literal dumpster fires, as people throw fake paper money into burning trash heaps to ensure that those who have passed onto the afterlife have enough money to spend.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, burning paper money for ah gong grew my connection to biblical perspectives on wealth. As a kid, these traditions were silly to me. As an adult, they took on new meaning. We take time out of our busy lives to burn money for ahgong because we love him, as he loved us. Indeed, in Taiwanese tradition, it would seem that what you reap in the afterlife is directly proportional to how you love when you are on earth. Maybe this is what Christ meant when he said in Matthew: “And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much”.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Grandpa comes over for dinner every now and then. We prepare his favourite dishes and lay them out for him. We then light incense and bow to welcome ahgong into his old damp apartment. My uncle then throws two coins. If they land the same side up, ahgong isn’t happy with our spread. If they land opposite sides up, ahgong is eating. Oftentimes, they’ll land on the same side and we’ll argue over what’s missing from our spread until someone tells me to run across the street and get ahgong a generous pour of beer. Only after we pour out the beer do the coins land on opposite sides, and grandpa starts eating. We give him a gentle head start, then we gather around the table enjoying our meal with him.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As a kid, these traditions were pagan and unworthy of respect and admiration. As an adult, I can’t help but notice how we gather to break bread and remember the love of those who came before us in a way no different from communion. In our remembrance, we pledge to love others the same way we were loved. Ahgong was one of the most Christlike people I know and I believe that every time we gather to eat and in every act of kindness I attempt, his spirit lives in me.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I don’t know if I really believe that there’s something in store for this soul in this body with its ACL torn and cholesterol high after I kick the bucket, but here’s what I do believe: In modeling a life of selfless love, Christ taught us how we attain eternal life. When we live Christ-like lives, our acts of kindness reverberate eternally across those whose lives we touch and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I believe that many people have received this message of grace both through the Christian faith and otherwise. These people have lived lives filled with warmth, sacrificial love, and a selfless devotion to others. I believe every day, with the little choices we make to channel the warmth they showed us, we keep their sacred spirits alive inside of us. May that love, the love exemplified by the Lord Jesus Christ, live inside all of us forever.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    \ type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;After a decade using macOS by-choice, I’ve decided it’s
    time to try something\nelse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m writing this on an early-2013
    MacBook Pro running Catalina. There’s some\ndust caught in the left fan, which
    means that as I’m using it, there’s an\ninsufferable rattling noise as the fan
    rotates, whacking against the dust inside\nthe machine. Fixing this is incredibly
    easy. One simply needs to open up the\nbottom, dig some dust out of the fan, and
    your computer is humming quietly\nagain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The catch: I don’t
    have a pentalobe screwdriver to open the bottom case of my\nMac.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In
    2008, way before I had my first laptop and when I still viewed Macs as\nmysterious,
    other-worldly machines, I remember seeing my friend’s 2008 Unibody\nMacbook Pro
    for the first time. The coolest part was when he showed me how to\nreplace the
    hard disk. There were these latches that you pulled to remove the\naccess door
    of your shiny aluminium laptop. It felt so elegant. This was a\nmachine designed
    for you to disassemble and upgrade as you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2013,
    as I was setting off to university for the first time, I remember\nbuying my ‘college
    laptop’. This felt like such a rite-of-passage for me. I knew\nI wanted it to
    be a Mac. I remember the thrill as I heard the Mac OS X chime for\nthe first time
    on my very own Mac. Computers are very personal devices, and I’d\nfelt so powerful
    knowing that this unibody laptop was mine to customize and\ntinker with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To
    use the cliche’d boiling frog analogy, nothing earth-shattering happened in\nthe
    last decade, but gradually, I’ve just felt that this computer doesn’t belong\nto
    me anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I upgraded to Catalina, I noticed that
    I was able to read Hacker News\nagain. This confused me because I edit my /etc/hosts
    file to block off the\nwebsite. It turns out that macOS Catalina locked down system
    files and you can\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250805304&quot;&gt;no
    longer edit your own /etc/hosts\nfile&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then the
    other day, I was trying to install the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nixos.org/&quot;&gt;nix
    package\nmanager&lt;/a&gt; to give reproducible package management a go.\nNix
    requires you to create a /nix directory in your root folder, where all of\nyour
    Nix packages will live. It does not touch your system in any way otherwise. \nThat’s
    when I hit yet another roadblock: Your root directory has been locked\ndown on
    Catalina and so &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/2925&quot;&gt;you
    can’t make a folder in\nRoot&lt;/a&gt;. There’s a workaround that\ninvolves, for
    “legacy” Macs like mine, mounting an unencrypted partition that\ncontains your
    Nix folder to /nix in your root directory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In what world
    do I, the owner of my laptop, not get the right to modify my own\nroot directory?
    I get that many users are not informed enough about the\ninner-workings of a Unix
    or Unix-like operating system and could irreparably\ndamage their OS install with
    root access, but that means Apple should put in the\nappropriate safeguards, not
    disable write in the Root directory altogether.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, some
    very clever people in the Nix ecosystem worked out a way to get Nix to\nplay nicely
    with this Catalina limitation, but this was a purely arbitrary and\nartificial
    constraint put in place by Apple. It sent a message to me: This is\nnot your machine.
    Tread carefully when you use it. Apple, in its quest to\nprotect its users from
    ourselves, has become hostile to tinkering. This is no\ndifferent from using nonstandard
    pentalobe screws to hold the bottom-case\nin-place. Handle with care, it whispers.
    This is a scary machine. Modify at your\nown risk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The laptop
    has been showing its age for quite a while and so I decided my next\nlaptop won’t
    be a Mac. I can’t accept that I don’t own my machine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve
    ordered a System76 Lemur Pro from their website. Linux has come leaps and\nbounds
    since I first booted up Ubuntu 9.04 Jaunty Jackalope on my computer back\nin 2009.
    System76 promises full compatibility with Linux in a laptop that’s just\naround
    a kilogram. The memory and storage are fully upgradeable and the company\npublishes
    in-depth how-to instructions for your model. The company makes an\neffort to disable
    Intel Management Engine (a security risk), and the laptop\nfirmware is open source.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The
    idea of voting with your wallet doesn’t work. I realize that the number of\nMac
    users who care deeply about having write-access to the Root directory is\nprobably
    not enough to affect Apple’s bottom-line in any meaningful way. That\nbeing said,
    the direction that macOS is heading in isn’t one I feel I can accept\nanymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I
    became a programmer in-part because open source demystified the computer for\nme.
    Seeing how passionate people were about various components of an operating\nsystem
    (window managers, compositors, init systems etc.) made me grapple with\nthe fundamentals
    of the magic that made my computer work. In elementary school,\nI installed a
    virus on a friend’s parent’s computer. We immediately shut it\ndown, and I, the
    resident computer ‘expert’, recommended we ‘let it rest’ as the\ncomputer ‘immune
    system’ fought the virus. There are many people out there like\nme, with very
    simplistic mental models for how computers work. That’s okay.\nThat’s why abstractions
    exist. We abstract away the complexities so people who\ndon’t care don’t have
    to think about the inner-workings of complicated systems.\nThat’s a beautiful
    thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beautiful abstractions are one thing, but intentionally
    locking down a system is\nanother. I don’t dread a world in which usable computers
    mean people don’t have\nto think about how they work. I dread a world in which
    computers actively fight\npeople who have the curiosity to dig a little deeper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My
    Lemur Pro is on the way, and I’m excited to give Linux a shot again.&lt;/p&gt;</content>"

    /&gt;\nA good way of determining this (if you are coming to Taiwan from overseas)
    is if you have (and entered Taiwan) with a green passport that says “Republic

    /&gt;\nThe simple way of putting this is: Do you have a ROC (Taiwan) government-issued
    ID that has a residency-address on it? If so, you have household registration
    here.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;If you intend to vote in referenda, you must be

    representatives. This is constituency-dependent. Civic hackers have compiled an
    online voting guide &lt;a href=&quot;https://councils.g0v.tw/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
    You can find your constituency by clicking on its general area and then the exact
    constituency (for example, I am in Xinyi District, Taipei City. I click on Taipei
    City (臺北市), and then Hsinyi District (信義區), and I’m now presented with &lt;a href=&quot;https://councils.g0v.tw/candidates/councilors/%E8%87%BA%E5%8C%97%E5%B8%82/3/#%E5%85%AD%E9%83%BD&quot;&gt;this

    &lt;p&gt;At the centre of this? A team of volunteers scurrying around the conference floor, leading around speakers, translating in booths and all clad in the same shirt with a g0v logo and emblazoned with a single, confusing word:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nobody&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I approach the summit information counter and ask one of the white-shirted ‘Nobodies’ in a shaky voice: “Excuse me: How exactly does one join g0v?”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;She cocks her head to one-side and replies: “…How do you mean? You’re already in it. This is g0v.”&lt;/p&gt;

      type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, tragedy struck Taiwan. A passenger train traveling down the East Coast &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-45932991&quot;&gt;derailed&lt;/a&gt;. 18 passengers lost their lives and over 100 were hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In times of chaos, it’s incredibly important that the public has access to accurate information. Families need to know about the status of their loved ones. Members of the public need to know how to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://liaokev.in/assets/2018/10/22/volunteers.png&quot; alt=&quot;Volunteers&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Volunteers start rallying on the g0v slack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;At around 6:45pm (two hours after the derailment), a thread popped up on the g0v Slack. &lt;a href=&quot;https://g0v.tw&quot;&gt;g0v&lt;/a&gt; (pronounced gov-zero) is a network of civic hackers and activists in Taiwan. People started floating different ways to help. Someone created a hackpad for us to centralize resources on.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;People started pitching in. Some offered to debunk fake news stories that were being circulated. Multilingual folks were translating news into English and Japanese. Others with coding expertise, like myself, volunteered to connect the public to data sources that were being publicized. The Ministry of Health was publishing a manifest of the injured and where they were being hospitalized. It was published on a Google Drive link that was periodically updated but was difficult to parse.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://liaokev.in/assets/2018/10/22/search_engine.png&quot; alt=&quot;Search&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;The search engine that g0v volunteers came up with for reuniting families.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Working with another volunteer named @yutin, we re-deployed a previously written static site for searching through lists of injured people to GitHub Pages. The only thing left to do was populate it with data. We needed to turn the xlsx sheet that the government was updating into something that the public could understand. @yutin and I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/g0v/1021puyuma&quot;&gt;each built different parsers for the data&lt;/a&gt;, one written in Golang and the other in JS. We’re now periodically checking the government’s official passenger manifest and re-parsing the data to make sure our &lt;a href=&quot;https://g0v.github.io/1021puyuma/&quot;&gt;search engine&lt;/a&gt; has up-to-date information.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://liaokev.in/assets/2018/10/22/disaster_information_center.png&quot; alt=&quot;Search&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;The final product: A publicly created disaster information center entirely built by volunteer action over 6 hours.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The end result? The public now has access to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackmd.io/c/PuyumaCrash-tw/&quot;&gt;disaster information hub&lt;/a&gt; that was entirely volunteer-compiled. Everything from local folk offering accommodation options to families of survivors to search engines so that families can be reunited. All this came together within 5 hours of the disaster striking.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://liaokev.in/assets/2018/10/22/blood_donation.png&quot; alt=&quot;Blood&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Information on where to donate blood.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While I’m absolutely devastated by this tragedy, the way that g0v responded gave me so much hope. A group of ordinary citizens banded together to create tools to help other ordinary people pull through a tragedy. There’s a lot in the news that makes me upset, but this was a reminder that there’s always more you can do to help.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    &lt;em&gt;Hamburger menu sliding in&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I spent most of yesterday working on a responsive menu for Maracuya. I wanted something that plays nicely with my BEMIT CSS setup. I ended up creating two menus. The first one is the desktop-sized menu, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;c-menu&lt;/code&gt;, which contains a list of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;c-menu__items&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;c-menu&lt;/code&gt; also contains &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;c-menu__hamburger-button&lt;/code&gt;, which is hidden by default.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If the screen width is small enough, all &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;c-menu__items&lt;/code&gt; are hidden and the hamburger button is shown. In addition, there is an off-screen &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; that is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;100vw&lt;/code&gt;. I added an event listener to the hamburger button that does a CSS transition to move the hamburger menu overlay in a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;position: fixed&lt;/code&gt; above our content.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is all super basic frontend design, but I’m learning quite a lot from implementing very basic things from scratch!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    a lot of things have been stressing me out. I’ve taken to working on improvements
    to this site that I gradually want to roll out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img

    previously used the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/kagami/&quot;&gt;Kagami
    Theme&lt;/a&gt; for my website. It was a nice, minimal theme that did its job.
    I got a little frustrated with my lack of ability in frontend and design so I
    decided to take matters into my own hands. I ripped all the CSS and classnames
    out of the website, changed up the HTML markup and decided to completely re-theme
    the website. I did this work in a separate branch while I continued to edit the
    content as usual. With today’s merge, the content is finally live.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img

    still working on Maracuya, but in the meantime, I’ve learned a lot of cliches
    about frontend design I want to share. These are all super basic for anyone who
    has done any real front-end work before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-maracuya&quot;&gt;Why
    Maracuya?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maracuya is the Peruvian Spanish word for the
    passionfruit. I ate an unhealthy of amount of Maracuya and Maracuya flavoured
    items while I was traveling in Peru. I love the purple colour of the Maracuya
    exterior and I wanted to write a theme that was a tribute to this great fruit.
    Unsure if I have any pictures of the Maracuya. Again, I’m feeling really lazy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3
    id=&quot;how-to-css-properly&quot;&gt;How to CSS Properly&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;h4
    id=&quot;scss-wow&quot;&gt;SCSS: …Wow.&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://yang.money&quot;&gt;Michael
    Yang&lt;/a&gt; recommended that I check out SCSS. SCSS is a stylesheet language
    that serves as syntactic sugar for CSS. I was able to nest selectors, making organization
    of my CSS intuitive. Something else really cool about SCSS is the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;
    operator, which allows you to nest CSS selectors that concatenate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For
    example, the stylesheet:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div
    class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;.c-post
    {  \n  &amp;amp;__metadata {  \n    margin-top: 20px;  \n    color: $light-black;
    \ \n    font-size: 0.8rem;  \n  }  \n  &amp;amp;__description {  \n    font-weight:
    $light;  \n    margin-top: 0;  \n  }  \n}  \n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Will
    compile to the following selectors:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div
    class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;.c-post__metadata
    {  \n  margin-top: 20px;  \n  color: $light-black;  \n  font-size: 0.8rem;  \n}
    \ \n.c-post__description {  \n  font-weight: $light;  \n  margin-top: 0;\n}  \n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;h4
    id=&quot;bemit-css-is-really-cool&quot;&gt;BEMIT CSS is really cool.&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;BEMIT
    is the combination of BEM and IT approaches to managing your CSS and it fits really
    well with using SASS. BEM requires you to split your CSS selectors by “Block,
    element and modifier”, while ITCSS refers to an “Inverted Triangle” that allows
    you to structure your CSS in a way that prioritizes some styles above others,
    starting with global style variables and finishing with individual style overrides.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly,
    I’m too tired (or incompetent) to properly and thoroughly explain these concepts.
    But they’re really cool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;ongoing-work&quot;&gt;Ongoing
    Work:&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Maracuya still needs a lot of work before I’m satisfied
    with the result, and here are some pieces of ongoing work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n
    \ &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsive Design:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t know how to
    handle mobile navigation. The easy way is to stuff everything into a hamburger
    menu, but angry reddit seems to tell me this is really poor usability. It looks
    good though so I’m really unsure what to do here. Advice appreciated.&lt;/li&gt;\n
    \ &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo Gallery:&lt;/strong&gt; I really like taking photos
    and having a centralized location where I can share all my photos would be really
    great!&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Portfolio:&lt;/strong&gt;
    Where I can share things that I’ve worked on!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;</content>"

    this November. Curtis is one of my long-standing volunteers and has made more
    than 200 dials since he has started. You can dial too! Make a difference today
    and reach out to me through &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:public@liaokev.in&quot;&gt;e-mail&lt;/a&gt;
    or on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.signal.org&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/a&gt; at +1(484)702-2952.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n
    \ &lt;li&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us a little bit about yourself!
    What do you do for a living and what are your hobbies?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;\nI
    just graduated from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.upenn.edu/&quot;&gt;Penn&lt;/a&gt;
    and am taking a year off, working in a biomedical engineering lab at the &lt;a
    href=&quot;https://umich.edu&quot;&gt;University of Michigan&lt;/a&gt; while I
    apply to grad school! In my spare time, I’m enjoying living within an hour’s drive
    of my family for the first time in four years, and am living out a dream of mine
    by substituting in the cello sections of professional orchestras in the area.&lt;/p&gt;\n
    \ &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you decide to
    phonebank?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nI’ve been so frustrated at the failures
    of the American Healthcare system, and at how boneheaded some members of Congress
    (and um the White House) are about the realities of climate change. In the future,
    I’d like to have enough of a platform to advocate for better &lt;em&gt;everything,&lt;/em&gt;
    but since I can’t get there before the midterms, I thought participating in grassroots
    politics was a good way to help.&lt;br /&gt;\nIn 2016, I donated some money, but
    this time around I wanted to do more. I’m confident that the effort I’ve been
    putting in on the phone has been making some difference, which is a confidence
    I didn’t have two years ago. \nThe catalyst for me getting involved was was when
    you &lt;a href=&quot;http://liaokev.in/2018/07/18/brb.html&quot;&gt;posted about&lt;/a&gt;
    the bureaucratic inefficiencies that kept you from going to your job, forcing
    you to leave the country.&lt;br /&gt;\nI commented on your post then, feeling
    a little ashamed that my government would do you dirty like that. I felt ashamed
    that I didn’t know enough about my government to help you, and then your call
    to action in your conclusion convinced me that I should go beyond liking posts
    on Facebook and really start fighting for what I believe to be right.&lt;/p&gt;\n
    \ &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has it been so far
    and what have you learned from doing it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nHonestly,
    some phonebanking sessions were really slow and people weren’t picking up and
    I was feeling pessimistic about my impact. But every so often, someone would be
    really receptive to what NVDems was trying to do, and that would give me a boost.
    Now, as we gain steam in the last month before the election, it’s getting even
    easier. Lots of people are joining us to volunteer, and we can always use more!
    Anyone who isn’t already volunteering, the best time to start is right now!&lt;br
    /&gt;\nI’ve learned so much. Voters are just ordinary people who want the best
    from their politicians. It was scary to make dials at first, but in connecting
    to fellow voters, it reminded me of how the government should be working for all
    of us, not just themselves and a few others. I’ve been becoming a lot more comfortable
    talking to and connecting with strangers, and have realized that a lot of people
    will give you a chance, if you’re friendly enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n
    \ &lt;li&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you could be any character from any
    book, who from which book?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nMaybe Captain Nemo, from
    Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea!&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;</content>"

    &lt;em&gt;With my Fellows, but I’m in the computer!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I was a hackNY Fellow last summer and I had a blast. Applications for the hackNY
    Fellows Class of 2019 application have just opened! I wanted to take the time to
    introduce the Fellowship to you and open myself up as a point-of-contact if you
    have questions about it!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-fellowship&quot;&gt;What is the Fellowship?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As a hackNY Fellow, you are matched with an NYC-based startup for the duration
    of your summer. Last year, we had Fellows working at BuzzFeed, Babble, Tumblr,
    First Look Media (The Intercept), TwoBulls, etc. Outside of your regular day
    job, you live with other Fellows in a dormitory in NYU. On two days of the week,
    you attend speaker series where folks share insights from various parts of
    industry. Talks we had last summer include:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Q&amp;amp;A with Jonah Peretti, CEO and Founder of BuzzFeed&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Shaving My Head Made Me a Better Programmer by Alex Qin from the Code
    Cooperative, which teaches formerly incarcerated and justice-involved people
    digital literacy and coding as a means of liberation.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Talk and Q&amp;amp;A with Amanda Cox, editor of the New York Times’ Upshot section on
    how the publication has successfully utilized data visualization and
    analytical journalism to create a compelling online presence&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;…and many many more.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In addition, Fellows take part in our Summer of Good Initiative, where they
    grapple with the ethics of our work in industry and give back by working in the
    public interest sector pro-bono. While the initiative is new and changing in
    form every year, some projects from my year include:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Working with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office to help them fight human
    trafficking cases&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Helping a non-profit music summer camp optimize admissions data to better
    serve low-income students&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Working on an app that explores how race affects our perception of police
    brutality and incarceration&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;…and many more again.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Finally, finishing the Fellowship means you become alumNY and an entire network
    of interesting people who have done the fellowship in the past become accessible
    to you. Some people say that the best part of hackNY is the network after you
    graduate and I can see why they believe that!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In my hackNY summer, I made some incredible friends (who I’m still very close
    with) and between the speaker series, exploring NYC and my Summer of Good
    Project, I found so much to do. Despite the issues I faced, this was by far the
    best summer that I ever had (including a summer spent working for big tech) and
    I want you to have the same.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-i-apply&quot;&gt;How Do I Apply?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Apply on our application website. hackNY applications are in three rounds and
    with each successive round, the admit rate drops as we fill up the class. As our
    Speaker Series and Summer of Good Initiatives will imply, we are looking for
    Fellows with not  just technical aptitude, but a passion for turning a group of
    people into an eclectic community and a desire to engage in questions
    surrounding the ethics of our work in industry. That’s why I wanted to send a
    special shoutout to any current Haverford students engaged in work with affinity
    groups, community organizing, or Customs. There are some opportunities in
    industry where your extracurricular work in ways unrelated directly to your
    technical aptitude help you shine and this is definitely one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I’ve put my application questions on a blog post in case you’re interested in
    reading them. Some other Fellows have done the same and you can find the links
    on our website.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;alumNY read applications and interview fellows according to a process described
    in-detail on our website, which means talking to an alumNY can really give you a
    better sense of what we’re looking for in Fellows. This brings me to my final
    thing:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;open-invitation-message-me&quot;&gt;Open Invitation: Message me!&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I’m happy to talk to anyone with questions about the fellowship! You can contact
    me at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:contact@liaokev.in&quot;&gt;contact@liaokev.in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
