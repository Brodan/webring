    I’ve been following a mental thread that has me exploring the idea of <em>planned
    economies</em>. If you’ve never heard of it before, strap on your economics hat
    and get ready for a wild ride. The high-level idea behind them is to allocate
    scarce resources according to a set of society or community level goals. These
    goals can be anything from pointing everything at building machinery for protecting
    oneself during a war<sup id=\"fnref:0\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:0\"

    <content base="http://liaokev.in/2023/05/21/baptism-statement.html"
      type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On May 21st in 2023, with friends and family joining in-person and online at Alameda State Beach in California, I was baptized. I was asked to share a testimony beforehand, so here’s what I shared. My sincerest gratitude to everyone who took time out of their busy lives to join in, whether it was online or in-person. This is a day I’ll cherish forever.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://liaokev.in/assets/2023/5/21/banner.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cover&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I left the church on a spring day in the 10th grade when my youth pastor told us that non-Christians can’t love. A little voice told me that didn’t make sense. So I listened to that little voice. I walked out of that church and I didn’t look back.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I have trepidation about baptism, as if this act today washes away the sin of many organizations that continue to explicitly preach, or implicitly condone blatant misogyny, homophobia and transphobia in the name of Christ. It does not. A better church can only come from breaking the wall of silence that we were all brought up to uphold. Our faith is too wide and our God too mighty to be interpreted in such a narrow and harmful way.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Years before I even knew that I could use the word bisexual to describe myself, my faith had a predestined identity chosen for me. When I left the church, I thought I would never return. However, at the same time, it was through this church, OakLife, that I first found queer community and belonging. God speaks and moves in contradictions in ways I’m still wrestling with.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Baptism and by-proxy the Christian faith is centered around death and resurrection. We do seem to like to talk about death as a faith tradition an awful lot, so it seems somewhat morbidly befitting to ponder about death. Today, I want to talk about the life and death of the most Christlike man that I know, my grandpa, or Ah Gong- who was not a follower of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;My earliest memories of my Ah Gong were as a toddler growing up in Australia. He had come down from Taiwan and I didn’t know why. My ah gong and ah ma were like extra parents, helping my mother around the house as she adjusted to life in a strange country. The spirit of our house was lifted as ah gong would sneak us M&amp;amp;Ms and cook us fried rice. We’d sit on his lap and he’d teach us nursery rhymes.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As an adult I learned that Ah Gong and Ah Ma were a mere months away from a generous lifetime pension that they forfeited to come down to care for my mother, who had just given birth to my sister. As they handed in their letters of resignation, their supervisor was astounded. The pension they were forfeiting was the salary of six employees. But a voice that I would call the holy spirit, the voice that compels acts of sacrificial love, commanded them to go, so they left.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When Ah Gong died, a question I’d been confronting since I was a child took on a new and sudden urgency. What happens when someone you love dies without believing? I didn’t have an answer and was filled with the same rage and resentment that I had felt as a kid when my faith seemingly had no answers for those who didn’t believe.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I looked for answers everywhere. Leaving the church gave me freedom to start taking part in Taiwanese traditions that form the basis for how we conceptualize death. I’d like to share a couple of unorganized thoughts about these traditions today, in hopes that with enough corn starch they will congeal together to form something vaguely resembling a statement of faith.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I started burning paper money. During “Ghost Month” in Taiwan, the streets are filled with literal dumpster fires, as people throw fake paper money into burning trash heaps to ensure that those who have passed onto the afterlife have enough money to spend.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, burning paper money for ah gong grew my connection to biblical perspectives on wealth. As a kid, these traditions were silly to me. As an adult, they took on new meaning. We take time out of our busy lives to burn money for ahgong because we love him, as he loved us. Indeed, in Taiwanese tradition, it would seem that what you reap in the afterlife is directly proportional to how you love when you are on earth. Maybe this is what Christ meant when he said in Matthew: “And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much”.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Grandpa comes over for dinner every now and then. We prepare his favourite dishes and lay them out for him. We then light incense and bow to welcome ahgong into his old damp apartment. My uncle then throws two coins. If they land the same side up, ahgong isn’t happy with our spread. If they land opposite sides up, ahgong is eating. Oftentimes, they’ll land on the same side and we’ll argue over what’s missing from our spread until someone tells me to run across the street and get ahgong a generous pour of beer. Only after we pour out the beer do the coins land on opposite sides, and grandpa starts eating. We give him a gentle head start, then we gather around the table enjoying our meal with him.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As a kid, these traditions were pagan and unworthy of respect and admiration. As an adult, I can’t help but notice how we gather to break bread and remember the love of those who came before us in a way no different from communion. In our remembrance, we pledge to love others the same way we were loved. Ahgong was one of the most Christlike people I know and I believe that every time we gather to eat and in every act of kindness I attempt, his spirit lives in me.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I don’t know if I really believe that there’s something in store for this soul in this body with its ACL torn and cholesterol high after I kick the bucket, but here’s what I do believe: In modeling a life of selfless love, Christ taught us how we attain eternal life. When we live Christ-like lives, our acts of kindness reverberate eternally across those whose lives we touch and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I believe that many people have received this message of grace both through the Christian faith and otherwise. These people have lived lives filled with warmth, sacrificial love, and a selfless devotion to others. I believe every day, with the little choices we make to channel the warmth they showed us, we keep their sacred spirits alive inside of us. May that love, the love exemplified by the Lord Jesus Christ, live inside all of us forever.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    \ type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;After a decade using macOS by-choice, I’ve decided it’s
    time to try something\nelse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m writing this on an early-2013
    MacBook Pro running Catalina. There’s some\ndust caught in the left fan, which
    means that as I’m using it, there’s an\ninsufferable rattling noise as the fan
    rotates, whacking against the dust inside\nthe machine. Fixing this is incredibly
    easy. One simply needs to open up the\nbottom, dig some dust out of the fan, and
    your computer is humming quietly\nagain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The catch: I don’t
    have a pentalobe screwdriver to open the bottom case of my\nMac.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In
    2008, way before I had my first laptop and when I still viewed Macs as\nmysterious,
    other-worldly machines, I remember seeing my friend’s 2008 Unibody\nMacbook Pro
    for the first time. The coolest part was when he showed me how to\nreplace the
    hard disk. There were these latches that you pulled to remove the\naccess door
    of your shiny aluminium laptop. It felt so elegant. This was a\nmachine designed
    for you to disassemble and upgrade as you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2013,
    as I was setting off to university for the first time, I remember\nbuying my ‘college
    laptop’. This felt like such a rite-of-passage for me. I knew\nI wanted it to
    be a Mac. I remember the thrill as I heard the Mac OS X chime for\nthe first time
    on my very own Mac. Computers are very personal devices, and I’d\nfelt so powerful
    knowing that this unibody laptop was mine to customize and\ntinker with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To
    use the cliche’d boiling frog analogy, nothing earth-shattering happened in\nthe
    last decade, but gradually, I’ve just felt that this computer doesn’t belong\nto
    me anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I upgraded to Catalina, I noticed that
    I was able to read Hacker News\nagain. This confused me because I edit my /etc/hosts
    file to block off the\nwebsite. It turns out that macOS Catalina locked down system
    files and you can\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250805304&quot;&gt;no
    longer edit your own /etc/hosts\nfile&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then the
    other day, I was trying to install the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nixos.org/&quot;&gt;nix
    package\nmanager&lt;/a&gt; to give reproducible package management a go.\nNix
    requires you to create a /nix directory in your root folder, where all of\nyour
    Nix packages will live. It does not touch your system in any way otherwise. \nThat’s
    when I hit yet another roadblock: Your root directory has been locked\ndown on
    Catalina and so &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/2925&quot;&gt;you
    can’t make a folder in\nRoot&lt;/a&gt;. There’s a workaround that\ninvolves, for
    “legacy” Macs like mine, mounting an unencrypted partition that\ncontains your
    Nix folder to /nix in your root directory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In what world
    do I, the owner of my laptop, not get the right to modify my own\nroot directory?
    I get that many users are not informed enough about the\ninner-workings of a Unix
    or Unix-like operating system and could irreparably\ndamage their OS install with
    root access, but that means Apple should put in the\nappropriate safeguards, not
    disable write in the Root directory altogether.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, some
    very clever people in the Nix ecosystem worked out a way to get Nix to\nplay nicely
    with this Catalina limitation, but this was a purely arbitrary and\nartificial
    constraint put in place by Apple. It sent a message to me: This is\nnot your machine.
    Tread carefully when you use it. Apple, in its quest to\nprotect its users from
    ourselves, has become hostile to tinkering. This is no\ndifferent from using nonstandard
    pentalobe screws to hold the bottom-case\nin-place. Handle with care, it whispers.
    This is a scary machine. Modify at your\nown risk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The laptop
    has been showing its age for quite a while and so I decided my next\nlaptop won’t
    be a Mac. I can’t accept that I don’t own my machine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve
    ordered a System76 Lemur Pro from their website. Linux has come leaps and\nbounds
    since I first booted up Ubuntu 9.04 Jaunty Jackalope on my computer back\nin 2009.
    System76 promises full compatibility with Linux in a laptop that’s just\naround
    a kilogram. The memory and storage are fully upgradeable and the company\npublishes
    in-depth how-to instructions for your model. The company makes an\neffort to disable
    Intel Management Engine (a security risk), and the laptop\nfirmware is open source.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The
    idea of voting with your wallet doesn’t work. I realize that the number of\nMac
    users who care deeply about having write-access to the Root directory is\nprobably
    not enough to affect Apple’s bottom-line in any meaningful way. That\nbeing said,
    the direction that macOS is heading in isn’t one I feel I can accept\nanymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I
    became a programmer in-part because open source demystified the computer for\nme.
    Seeing how passionate people were about various components of an operating\nsystem
    (window managers, compositors, init systems etc.) made me grapple with\nthe fundamentals
    of the magic that made my computer work. In elementary school,\nI installed a
    virus on a friend’s parent’s computer. We immediately shut it\ndown, and I, the
    resident computer ‘expert’, recommended we ‘let it rest’ as the\ncomputer ‘immune
    system’ fought the virus. There are many people out there like\nme, with very
    simplistic mental models for how computers work. That’s okay.\nThat’s why abstractions
    exist. We abstract away the complexities so people who\ndon’t care don’t have
    to think about the inner-workings of complicated systems.\nThat’s a beautiful
    thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beautiful abstractions are one thing, but intentionally
    locking down a system is\nanother. I don’t dread a world in which usable computers
    mean people don’t have\nto think about how they work. I dread a world in which
    computers actively fight\npeople who have the curiosity to dig a little deeper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My
    Lemur Pro is on the way, and I’m excited to give Linux a shot again.&lt;/p&gt;</content>"

    is to vote NO to 10-12 and YES on 14-15. See you on Nov. 24th!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img

    /&gt; \n&lt;em&gt;Taiwan is home to Asia’s largest LGBTQ Pride, which took place
    last week.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This guide is designed for overseas
    Taiwanese who might find themselves in Taiwan on election day. Election day is
    Saturday Nov. 24.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&quot;can-i-vote&quot;&gt;Can I vote?&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In
    order to vote, you must be:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Located
    in Taiwan on the day of the election.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nTaiwan does
    &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; allow absentee voting.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You
    must be a national of the Republic of China (the government of Taiwan).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br

    alt=&quot;Passport&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Taiwanese Passport&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br
    /&gt;\nA good way of determining this (if you are coming to Taiwan from overseas)
    is if you have (and entered Taiwan) with a green passport that says “Republic
    of China– Taiwan” on it.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You must have household
    registration in Taiwan.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;http://liaokev.in/assets/2018/10/31/national_id.jpg&quot;
    alt=&quot;National ID&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;sample National ID&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br
    /&gt;\nThe simple way of putting this is: Do you have a ROC (Taiwan) government-issued
    ID that has a residency-address on it? If so, you have household registration
    here.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;If you intend to vote in referenda, you must be
    18 years of age.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;If you intend to vote for elected officials,
    you must be 20 years of age.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that tackled,
    let’s tackle voting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&quot;who-do-i-vote-for&quot;&gt;Who
    do I Vote For?&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I can’t provide a guide to voting on your
    representatives. This is constituency-dependent. Civic hackers have compiled an
    online voting guide &lt;a href=&quot;https://councils.g0v.tw/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
    You can find your constituency by clicking on its general area and then the exact
    constituency (for example, I am in Xinyi District, Taipei City. I click on Taipei
    City (臺北市), and then Hsinyi District (信義區), and I’m now presented with &lt;a href=&quot;https://councils.g0v.tw/candidates/councilors/%E8%87%BA%E5%8C%97%E5%B8%82/3/#%E5%85%AD%E9%83%BD&quot;&gt;this
    page&lt;/a&gt;. It gives me a list of my candidates, their financial assets, and
    their experience. For each candidate, you can click 了解更多, which means “Understand
    more”. You will have to make generous use of Google Translate, or your parents
    if you want to understand more about your candidates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-do-i-vote-on&quot;&gt;What
    Do I Vote On?&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Wow you are really spoilt for choice this year!
    The current Tsai-DPP Administration has softened the restrictions on bringing
    a referendum to the public. This means, the public is voting on &lt;strong&gt;TEN&lt;/strong&gt;
    proposals this year. A whopping &lt;strong&gt;FIVE&lt;/strong&gt; of these are
    related to the LGBTQ community and marriage equality. In addition, we are voting
    on everything from green energy to the team name we compete under in the Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve
    provided a list of the referenda below and attempted to give a literal translation
    as well as an explanation of them below. I’ve tried to be as objective as possible,
    but I have my biases.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The count starts from 7 because there
    have been 6 referenda in the past in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&quot;coal-fired-powerplant-referenda&quot;&gt;Coal-Fired

    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3433730&quot;&gt;generated
    less than 2% of its energy from renewable sources&lt;/a&gt;. The Taichung Coal-Fired
    Powerplant emits more CO2 than the entirety of Switzerland. That being said, Taiwan
    is in the middle of an energy crisis because we have closed the bulk of our nuclear
    plants in the wake of the Fukushima Disaster in Japan and are struggling to switch
    to renewable resources.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;referendum-7-air-pollution-and-energy-production&quot;&gt;Referendum

    be created instead of just redefining marriage. The folks proposing 10-12 are
    arguing that same-gender couples should not be allowed to adopt children, or enjoy

    &lt;p&gt;At the centre of this? A team of volunteers scurrying around the conference floor, leading around speakers, translating in booths and all clad in the same shirt with a g0v logo and emblazoned with a single, confusing word:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nobody&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I approach the summit information counter and ask one of the white-shirted ‘Nobodies’ in a shaky voice: “Excuse me: How exactly does one join g0v?”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;She cocks her head to one-side and replies: “…How do you mean? You’re already in it. This is g0v.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <content base="http://liaokev.in/2018/10/22/how-g0v-works.html"
      type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, tragedy struck Taiwan. A passenger train traveling down the East Coast &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-45932991&quot;&gt;derailed&lt;/a&gt;. 18 passengers lost their lives and over 100 were hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In times of chaos, it’s incredibly important that the public has access to accurate information. Families need to know about the status of their loved ones. Members of the public need to know how to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://liaokev.in/assets/2018/10/22/volunteers.png&quot; alt=&quot;Volunteers&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Volunteers start rallying on the g0v slack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;At around 6:45pm (two hours after the derailment), a thread popped up on the g0v Slack. &lt;a href=&quot;https://g0v.tw&quot;&gt;g0v&lt;/a&gt; (pronounced gov-zero) is a network of civic hackers and activists in Taiwan. People started floating different ways to help. Someone created a hackpad for us to centralize resources on.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;People started pitching in. Some offered to debunk fake news stories that were being circulated. Multilingual folks were translating news into English and Japanese. Others with coding expertise, like myself, volunteered to connect the public to data sources that were being publicized. The Ministry of Health was publishing a manifest of the injured and where they were being hospitalized. It was published on a Google Drive link that was periodically updated but was difficult to parse.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://liaokev.in/assets/2018/10/22/search_engine.png&quot; alt=&quot;Search&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;The search engine that g0v volunteers came up with for reuniting families.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Working with another volunteer named @yutin, we re-deployed a previously written static site for searching through lists of injured people to GitHub Pages. The only thing left to do was populate it with data. We needed to turn the xlsx sheet that the government was updating into something that the public could understand. @yutin and I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/g0v/1021puyuma&quot;&gt;each built different parsers for the data&lt;/a&gt;, one written in Golang and the other in JS. We’re now periodically checking the government’s official passenger manifest and re-parsing the data to make sure our &lt;a href=&quot;https://g0v.github.io/1021puyuma/&quot;&gt;search engine&lt;/a&gt; has up-to-date information.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://liaokev.in/assets/2018/10/22/disaster_information_center.png&quot; alt=&quot;Search&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;The final product: A publicly created disaster information center entirely built by volunteer action over 6 hours.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The end result? The public now has access to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackmd.io/c/PuyumaCrash-tw/&quot;&gt;disaster information hub&lt;/a&gt; that was entirely volunteer-compiled. Everything from local folk offering accommodation options to families of survivors to search engines so that families can be reunited. All this came together within 5 hours of the disaster striking.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://liaokev.in/assets/2018/10/22/blood_donation.png&quot; alt=&quot;Blood&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Information on where to donate blood.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While I’m absolutely devastated by this tragedy, the way that g0v responded gave me so much hope. A group of ordinary citizens banded together to create tools to help other ordinary people pull through a tragedy. There’s a lot in the news that makes me upset, but this was a reminder that there’s always more you can do to help.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    &lt;em&gt;Hamburger menu sliding in&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I spent most of yesterday working on a responsive menu for Maracuya. I wanted something that plays nicely with my BEMIT CSS setup. I ended up creating two menus. The first one is the desktop-sized menu, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;c-menu&lt;/code&gt;, which contains a list of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;c-menu__items&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;c-menu&lt;/code&gt; also contains &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;c-menu__hamburger-button&lt;/code&gt;, which is hidden by default.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If the screen width is small enough, all &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;c-menu__items&lt;/code&gt; are hidden and the hamburger button is shown. In addition, there is an off-screen &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; that is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;100vw&lt;/code&gt;. I added an event listener to the hamburger button that does a CSS transition to move the hamburger menu overlay in a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;position: fixed&lt;/code&gt; above our content.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is all super basic frontend design, but I’m learning quite a lot from implementing very basic things from scratch!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  description: "<content base=\"http://liaokev.in/2018/10/18/redesign.html\"\n  type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Lately,
    a lot of things have been stressing me out. I’ve taken to working on improvements
    to this site that I gradually want to roll out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img
    src=&quot;http://liaokev.in/assets/2018/10/18/kagami.png&quot; alt=&quot;Kagami&quot;
    /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;The site under the Kagami theme&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I
    previously used the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/kagami/&quot;&gt;Kagami
    Theme&lt;/a&gt; for my website. It was a nice, minimal theme that did its job.
    I got a little frustrated with my lack of ability in frontend and design so I
    decided to take matters into my own hands. I ripped all the CSS and classnames
    out of the website, changed up the HTML markup and decided to completely re-theme
    the website. I did this work in a separate branch while I continued to edit the
    content as usual. With today’s merge, the content is finally live.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img
    src=&quot;http://liaokev.in/assets/2018/10/18/maracuya.png&quot; alt=&quot;Maracuya&quot;
    /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;The site under the Maracuya theme&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m
    still working on Maracuya, but in the meantime, I’ve learned a lot of cliches
    about frontend design I want to share. These are all super basic for anyone who
    has done any real front-end work before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-maracuya&quot;&gt;Why
    Maracuya?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maracuya is the Peruvian Spanish word for the
    passionfruit. I ate an unhealthy of amount of Maracuya and Maracuya flavoured
    items while I was traveling in Peru. I love the purple colour of the Maracuya
    exterior and I wanted to write a theme that was a tribute to this great fruit.
    Unsure if I have any pictures of the Maracuya. Again, I’m feeling really lazy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3
    id=&quot;how-to-css-properly&quot;&gt;How to CSS Properly&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;h4
    id=&quot;scss-wow&quot;&gt;SCSS: …Wow.&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://yang.money&quot;&gt;Michael
    Yang&lt;/a&gt; recommended that I check out SCSS. SCSS is a stylesheet language
    that serves as syntactic sugar for CSS. I was able to nest selectors, making organization
    of my CSS intuitive. Something else really cool about SCSS is the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;
    operator, which allows you to nest CSS selectors that concatenate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For
    example, the stylesheet:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div
    class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;.c-post
    {  \n  &amp;amp;__metadata {  \n    margin-top: 20px;  \n    color: $light-black;
    \ \n    font-size: 0.8rem;  \n  }  \n  &amp;amp;__description {  \n    font-weight:
    $light;  \n    margin-top: 0;  \n  }  \n}  \n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Will
    compile to the following selectors:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div
    class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;.c-post__metadata
    {  \n  margin-top: 20px;  \n  color: $light-black;  \n  font-size: 0.8rem;  \n}
    \ \n.c-post__description {  \n  font-weight: $light;  \n  margin-top: 0;\n}  \n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;h4
    id=&quot;bemit-css-is-really-cool&quot;&gt;BEMIT CSS is really cool.&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;BEMIT
    is the combination of BEM and IT approaches to managing your CSS and it fits really
    well with using SASS. BEM requires you to split your CSS selectors by “Block,
    element and modifier”, while ITCSS refers to an “Inverted Triangle” that allows
    you to structure your CSS in a way that prioritizes some styles above others,
    starting with global style variables and finishing with individual style overrides.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly,
    I’m too tired (or incompetent) to properly and thoroughly explain these concepts.
    But they’re really cool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;ongoing-work&quot;&gt;Ongoing
    Work:&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Maracuya still needs a lot of work before I’m satisfied
    with the result, and here are some pieces of ongoing work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n
    \ &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsive Design:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t know how to
    handle mobile navigation. The easy way is to stuff everything into a hamburger
    menu, but angry reddit seems to tell me this is really poor usability. It looks
    good though so I’m really unsure what to do here. Advice appreciated.&lt;/li&gt;\n
    \ &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo Gallery:&lt;/strong&gt; I really like taking photos
    and having a centralized location where I can share all my photos would be really
    great!&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Portfolio:&lt;/strong&gt;
    Where I can share things that I’ve worked on!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;</content>"

    making dials to help the Nevada State Democrats elect some incredible candidates
    this November. Curtis is one of my long-standing volunteers and has made more
    than 200 dials since he has started. You can dial too! Make a difference today

    \ &lt;li&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us a little bit about yourself!
    What do you do for a living and what are your hobbies?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;\nI
    just graduated from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.upenn.edu/&quot;&gt;Penn&lt;/a&gt;
    and am taking a year off, working in a biomedical engineering lab at the &lt;a
    href=&quot;https://umich.edu&quot;&gt;University of Michigan&lt;/a&gt; while I
    apply to grad school! In my spare time, I’m enjoying living within an hour’s drive
    of my family for the first time in four years, and am living out a dream of mine
    by substituting in the cello sections of professional orchestras in the area.&lt;/p&gt;\n
    \ &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you decide to
    phonebank?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nI’ve been so frustrated at the failures
    of the American Healthcare system, and at how boneheaded some members of Congress
    (and um the White House) are about the realities of climate change. In the future,
    I’d like to have enough of a platform to advocate for better &lt;em&gt;everything,&lt;/em&gt;
    but since I can’t get there before the midterms, I thought participating in grassroots
    politics was a good way to help.&lt;br /&gt;\nIn 2016, I donated some money, but
    this time around I wanted to do more. I’m confident that the effort I’ve been
    putting in on the phone has been making some difference, which is a confidence
    I didn’t have two years ago. \nThe catalyst for me getting involved was was when
    you &lt;a href=&quot;http://liaokev.in/2018/07/18/brb.html&quot;&gt;posted about&lt;/a&gt;
    the bureaucratic inefficiencies that kept you from going to your job, forcing
    you to leave the country.&lt;br /&gt;\nI commented on your post then, feeling
    a little ashamed that my government would do you dirty like that. I felt ashamed
    that I didn’t know enough about my government to help you, and then your call
    to action in your conclusion convinced me that I should go beyond liking posts
    on Facebook and really start fighting for what I believe to be right.&lt;/p&gt;\n
    \ &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has it been so far
    and what have you learned from doing it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nHonestly,
    some phonebanking sessions were really slow and people weren’t picking up and
    I was feeling pessimistic about my impact. But every so often, someone would be
    really receptive to what NVDems was trying to do, and that would give me a boost.
    Now, as we gain steam in the last month before the election, it’s getting even
    easier. Lots of people are joining us to volunteer, and we can always use more!
    Anyone who isn’t already volunteering, the best time to start is right now!&lt;br
    /&gt;\nI’ve learned so much. Voters are just ordinary people who want the best
    from their politicians. It was scary to make dials at first, but in connecting
    to fellow voters, it reminded me of how the government should be working for all
    of us, not just themselves and a few others. I’ve been becoming a lot more comfortable
    talking to and connecting with strangers, and have realized that a lot of people
    will give you a chance, if you’re friendly enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n
    \ &lt;li&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you could be any character from any
    book, who from which book?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nMaybe Captain Nemo, from
    Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea!&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;</content>"

      type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://liaokev.in/assets/2018/9/30/hackny.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;hackNY &#39;18&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;With my Fellows, but I’m in the computer!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I was a hackNY Fellow last summer and I had a blast. Applications for the hackNY
    Fellows Class of 2019 application have just opened! I wanted to take the time to
    introduce the Fellowship to you and open myself up as a point-of-contact if you
    have questions about it!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-fellowship&quot;&gt;What is the Fellowship?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As a hackNY Fellow, you are matched with an NYC-based startup for the duration
    of your summer. Last year, we had Fellows working at BuzzFeed, Babble, Tumblr,
    First Look Media (The Intercept), TwoBulls, etc. Outside of your regular day
    job, you live with other Fellows in a dormitory in NYU. On two days of the week,
    you attend speaker series where folks share insights from various parts of
    industry. Talks we had last summer include:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Q&amp;amp;A with Jonah Peretti, CEO and Founder of BuzzFeed&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Shaving My Head Made Me a Better Programmer by Alex Qin from the Code
    Cooperative, which teaches formerly incarcerated and justice-involved people
    digital literacy and coding as a means of liberation.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Talk and Q&amp;amp;A with Amanda Cox, editor of the New York Times’ Upshot section on
    how the publication has successfully utilized data visualization and
    analytical journalism to create a compelling online presence&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;…and many many more.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In addition, Fellows take part in our Summer of Good Initiative, where they
    grapple with the ethics of our work in industry and give back by working in the
    public interest sector pro-bono. While the initiative is new and changing in
    form every year, some projects from my year include:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Working with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office to help them fight human
    trafficking cases&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Helping a non-profit music summer camp optimize admissions data to better
    serve low-income students&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Working on an app that explores how race affects our perception of police
    brutality and incarceration&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;…and many more again.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Finally, finishing the Fellowship means you become alumNY and an entire network
    of interesting people who have done the fellowship in the past become accessible
    to you. Some people say that the best part of hackNY is the network after you
    graduate and I can see why they believe that!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In my hackNY summer, I made some incredible friends (who I’m still very close
    with) and between the speaker series, exploring NYC and my Summer of Good
    Project, I found so much to do. Despite the issues I faced, this was by far the
    best summer that I ever had (including a summer spent working for big tech) and
    I want you to have the same.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-i-apply&quot;&gt;How Do I Apply?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Apply on our application website. hackNY applications are in three rounds and
    with each successive round, the admit rate drops as we fill up the class. As our
    Speaker Series and Summer of Good Initiatives will imply, we are looking for
    Fellows with not  just technical aptitude, but a passion for turning a group of
    people into an eclectic community and a desire to engage in questions
    surrounding the ethics of our work in industry. That’s why I wanted to send a
    special shoutout to any current Haverford students engaged in work with affinity
    groups, community organizing, or Customs. There are some opportunities in
    industry where your extracurricular work in ways unrelated directly to your
    technical aptitude help you shine and this is definitely one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I’ve put my application questions on a blog post in case you’re interested in
    reading them. Some other Fellows have done the same and you can find the links
    on our website.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;alumNY read applications and interview fellows according to a process described
    in-detail on our website, which means talking to an alumNY can really give you a
    better sense of what we’re looking for in Fellows. This brings me to my final
    thing:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;open-invitation-message-me&quot;&gt;Open Invitation: Message me!&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I’m happy to talk to anyone with questions about the fellowship! You can contact
    me at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:contact@liaokev.in&quot;&gt;contact@liaokev.in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
