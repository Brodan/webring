    I’ve been following a mental thread that has me exploring the idea of <em>planned
    economies</em>. If you’ve never heard of it before, strap on your economics hat
    and get ready for a wild ride. The high-level idea behind them is to allocate
    scarce resources according to a set of society or community level goals. These
    goals can be anything from pointing everything at building machinery for protecting
    oneself during a war<sup id=\"fnref:0\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:0\"
    class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> to transitioning to a sustainable

    Colombia that Mapy planned! We started with a bowl full of frozen ants and had
    to remove the head (because the pincers will still cut you), legs, and wings.
    Then, we fried them on some traditional ceramic cookware from the region. We tasted
    a few when they were rare, medium-rare, and well done.</p><p>Certainty, an experience
    I'll never forget. The smells and tastes were so fun. I loved seeing Mapy's reactions
    as she got out of her comfort zone. The woman who taught the workshop was part
    of a collective commune and told us how she's been building community with it
    and elevating people. It was all so fun and brought me a lot of joy, and I hope
    I can do it again one day.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1704472221964/0fe1c7da-d700-41cd-8253-1fffd18e993e.jpeg\"

  title: Cancelling Vienna's Annual Pass Early
  url: https://blog.rayberger.org/cancelling-viennas-annual-pass-early
  fellow: *2
  description: <p>I'm writing this blog post about canceling my <a target="_blank"
    href="https://www.wienerlinien.at/web/wl-en/annual-pass">Weiner Linen annual pass</a>
    with the hope it saves someone a little hassle.</p><p>This blog post was written
    in October 2023 but this happened back in July.</p><p>When I moved to Vienna I
    wasn't eligible for the public transit student card because I was older than 25.
    The next cheapest option for riding daily is the annual ticket. Unfortunately,
    I was only staying in Vienna for a year so I just gotta cancel the ticket early
    to get a partial refund.</p><p>"Just" is the keyword here. When I ordered the
    annual pass the physical card never came in the mail but since I had it in my
    phone I didn't request a replacement.</p><h2 id="heading-cancelling">Cancelling</h2><p>As
    the date of my move out got closer I researched how to cancel the annual pass.
    Turns out you need to go to one of a few physical locations. My friend went to
    one location and said they were unhelpful and recommended I go to <a target="_blank"
    href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/rZ8PY3Q1bDUC92Co9">this one</a> and be done in five
    minutes.</p><p>When I arrived they told me that since I don't have the physical
    card I have to file a lost request form, print it out, and bring it back. I asked
    them if it was possible to fill out the form at the counter. They insisted they
    couldn't print it and that it was not possible to do it with them because <a target="_blank"
    href="https://www.fundamt.gv.at/WebPublic/">the form</a> was too complicated and
    not available in English. They recommended going to a print shop but that wasn't
    an option before they closed. Turns out the form didn't take 5 minutes to fill
    out using Google Translate and only asked basic questions.</p><p>That day was
    my last day in the city that they were open and there wasn't time so I asked if
    a friend could do it.</p><p>They said my friend needs to bring:</p><ul><li><p>A
    special doc (which they gave to me) that authorizes someone to act in your behalf</p></li><li><p>A
    printed copy of my ID</p></li><li><p>The report of the lost card</p></li><li><p>Maybe
    money to pay the lost card fee (turns out they never asked)</p></li></ul><p>My
    friend brought these and <strong>canceled my card without a problem</strong>.
    However, she did mention that they were annoyed that the address I put on the
    form for the lost card didn't match the address in my account (since I moved after
    opening my account).</p><p>There you have it. Canceling the card isn't so bad
    and well worth the cost savings. But if you don't have the physical card just
    fill out the form ahead of time. Unfortunately, this info didn't seem easy to
    find online and even when I called them they couldn't tell me what the form to
    fill was. After publishing this blog Vienna started offering the "digital-only
    annual pass" so hopefully this won't be an issue for anyone else!</p>

    to set up and hard to censor (due to being federated). I look forward to seeing
    how the fediverse will grow with platforms like Lemmy and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ernestwisniewski/kbin">kbin</a>

    of Lemmy has <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/dessalines/essays/blob/master/socialism_faq.md">some
    political views</a> that I dont agree with. However, Lemmy is still contributing
    to the greater good and inherently designed so people can spin up a new instance
    if they have different opinions so Im happy I was able to contribute in my small

  description: '<p><a target="_blank" href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865847/redteamblues"><em>Red
    Team Blues</em></a> is the first book in a new series by <a target="_blank" href="https://craphound.com/">Cory
    Doctorow</a>. In the near future, a retired forensic accountant, Martin Hench
    takes on one final job for an old friend. What follows is an unconventional who-done-it,
    featuring romance, gang warfare, philosophical ponderings, twists and turns, and
    problems with no clear solution. The title is a play on the words <a target="_blank"
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team">Red Team</a>, which is the attackers
    in security, and Blues which is to be sad but also ironic because the red team
    is usually pitted against the blue team.</p><p>I love how Doctorow makes Martin
    Hench, the 67-year-old retired accountant, relatable and have a thrilling story
    as he tries to navigate a world of opportunities to give up his morals and take
    the easy path. The books critiques of surveillance and Martins balanced approach
    to securing his activities inspire me to fight for a world where we dont have
    to jump through so many hoops for some privacy.</p><p>Although the book contains
    some pretty gruesome descriptions of hurt people, those dont dominate the story
    and are well balanced by the romantic and adventure parts. I listened to <a target="_blank"
    href="https://libro.fm/audiobooks/5184389278339-red-team-blues">the audiobook</a>,
    narrated by <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wil_Wheaton">Wil
    Wheaton</a>, which is so well acted it intensified all of the ups and downs.</p><p>My
    only real complaint about this book (but hey you cant do it all) was the ending.
    The book clearly has some strong moral messages about problems (like surveillance)
    and how we can avoid them long term. However, at the end of the book (small spoiler
    here), the character simply donates a large amount of money to an organization
    helping homeless people. For all the big ideas this book puts out Im a bit disappointed
    it didnt touch more on the root causes of homelessness (property speculation,
    weak tenant protections, inaccessible healthcare, etc) which arent addressed by
    homeless shelters. Perhaps thats saved for one of the next books in the series
    ;)</p><p>In short, I loved this book and would recommend it to anyone looking
    for a short, exciting, and educational story. Im quite excited for the next book
    in the series <em>The Bezzle,</em> which is just one of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doctorow/red-team-blues-another-audiobook-that-amazon-wont-sell/posts/3861247">many</a>
    books Doctorow has coming down the pipeline.</p><p>Disclaimer: Doctorow offered
    to add your name to the end of the next book if you write a review and send it
    to him. Thats a partial motivation for writing this but I already paid for the
    book before I knew about that offer.</p>'

  title: Migrating Between Matrix (Element) Accounts for Beeper
  url: https://blog.rayberger.org/migrating-matrix-accounts
  fellow: *2
  description: "<p>I was recently invited to Beeper (one chat app for fb/insta/discord/linkedin/etc).
    It has definitely helped me stay up-to-date with replying to friends across different
    chat apps as I can now see them all in one place.</p><p>Beeper doesnt let you
    connect a Matrix account (yet). Which kinda makes sense since Beeper gives you
    a Matrix account when you sign up. Since Ive been enjoying Beeper so much I decided
    to try to move a few chats from my main Matrix account to there.</p><p>I <a target=\"_blank\"
    href=\"http://kagi.com/\">Kagid</a> around a bit and didnt see too much about
    how one should migrate accounts. I did see <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ems.element.io/tools/matrix-migration\">this
    tool</a> to do it for you. However, the tool says This is a labs feature and should
    be used with caution and I dont want to share my credentials to see how well it
    works. It does say this though:</p><blockquote><p>Migration is performed by logging
    in on behalf of your old and new accounts and automatically inviting your new
    account in to all of the rooms that your old account is in. You can optionally
    request that your old user leaves rooms once the new user has successfully joined.</p></blockquote><p>I
    decided to try it for myself manually. First, I created a chat between my Beeper
    and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://Matrix.org\">Matrix.org</a> accounts. Then
    I added my Beeper account to a 1:1 chat with a friend.</p><h1 id=\"heading-decrypting-messages\">Decrypting
    Messages</h1><p>Unfortunately, thats where I hit my first snag, the <a target=\"_blank\"
    href=\"https://github.com/vector-im/element-meta/issues/245\">dreaded</a> error
    message:</p><blockquote><p>Unable to decrypt: The sender's device has not sent
    us the keys for this message.</p></blockquote><p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/TnhlK6A7dbjDQfi6q4sXRCA2mojUR8-M1v6GMh5ULA1ONnAbim80E9Sm7g2IN46zMd-rFIqnlGYFSx_gjYv96R7z_3q41EdVKA-IJIWer_GMpscLTx1hPhZJiTV9t_blI6kvQUMIvVjaEU9Zyj5CYkA\"
    alt=\"Screenshot of Beeper chat with previously metioned error message.\" /></p><p>It
    was showing this for messages from my Matrix account and from my friend. I waited
    a while. I clicked the force sync button. I didnt see any request on my other
    devices to send keys. I found <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/vector-im/element-meta/issues/245\">this</a>
    relatively recent (2023) meta issue about encryption issues and how theyre being
    addressed by the Element R (rust) crypto library being rolled out. This tells
    me it is still an issue. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://blog.neko.dev/posts/unable-to-decrypt-matrix.html\">blog
    post</a> linked in the thread gave me the idea to poke around in my settings and
    see what I can find. I verified the session between my two accounts but it didn't
    help. I kept digging around.</p><p>Lo and behold: theres an option to Import and
    Export E2E room keys. It seemed like it might help and it couldnt hurt so I went
    ahead and exported the keys from my Matrix account and imported them into my Beeper
    account. Voil, now all the messages are decrypted! \U0001F44F</p><p>I added my
    Beeper account to a big (10+) E2E group chat. The same issue happened, but over
    a few minutes some of the messages showed up from people who were online but most
    remained encrypted. I once again imported the same keys to Beeper and boom, all
    the messages were readable. Awesome!</p><h1 id=\"heading-making-accounts-admin\">Making
    Accounts Admin</h1><p>One other issue, I want to make my Beeper account Admin
    in these rooms. I click Room Info -&gt; People -&gt; My Beeper account but dont
    see any option to make someone else an admin. I just see these options:</p><p><img
    src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/HgHKvRsKGFjqus6uShfzp7bmnWrBvpayApctioX8VUOMjjfVO76nKDHE0kvA9gpCEqNqDVgYq-ixHcOQXo7RjxJjxOd1FUqqYNcBNVFjKqDjQ-6vxDEcFxQj6Dw3Ys8IXkx68hjVUnkj1uULu4LOEz8\"
    alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p><p>Confused, I google How to make someone
    a room admin in Matrix and similar phrases but dont come up with anything. After
    a while, I figured out to click setting on the room and then under Role &amp;
    Permissions you can add someone as admin. Its a bit tucked away, and definitely
    room for improvement with the Element clients but it worked like a charm.</p><h1
    id=\"heading-summary\">Summary</h1><p>The migration was a bit annoying, but overall
    Im happy that it was relatively easy to migrate accounts and that, with a little
    polish, the process should be no problem in the future.</p><p>On a side note:
    I do worry about completely relying on Beeper for my Matrix chats. They are a
    VC-backed company that may not be around too long. However, theyve built a great
    experience that Im willing to pay for when the time comes so Ill enjoy it while
    it lasts. Oh, also it sucks that Beeper <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack\">MITM</a>
    all your messages but the end UX is nice enough to justify it for now.</p><p>PS:
    Someone should make a video demo of the Matrix migration tool so people can see
    how it works. Specifically, does it move all your chats or let you select which
    ones to move? Does it handle the keys issue I had to deal with manually?</p>"

    survey asked "Where did you cry in Brussels?" and "How many tears did you cry?"

    inspires me to dig deep into things that interest me no matter what others say.
    The film also talks a lot about how the couple heavily depended on each other

  description: <p>I generally try to keep my inbox clean. That means unsubscribing
    from everything I don't read and sending newsletters to a specific folder so I
    don't get push notifications for them.</p><p>However, I never created filters
    for financial emails. Somehow, I thought that if I did I'd miss some important
    bill or alert. I've been getting these emails for around a decade now and never
    once has one of the emails been time sensitive.</p><p>So I've finally set up a
    filter in Gmail and it looks like this:</p><p>Skip inbox and add the label "Financial"
    if it's from any of the senders</p><pre><code class="lang-plaintext">betterment.com
    OR chase.com OR coinbase.com OR discover.com OR freetaxusa.com OR glhec.org OR

    OR paypal.com OR personalcapital.com OR robinhood.com OR uphold.com OR vanguard.com

    days to see if there's anything to deal with.</p>

    target="_blank" href="https://openlibrary.org/">Open Library</a> that I felt compelled
    to write a short blog post about it.</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong> I found out
    why the search API wasnt working as I expected and had <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/pull/7435">my

    mentor</a>. They''re always looking for <a target="_blank" href="https://openlibrary.org/volunteer">more
    designers, translators, and general volunteers</a>.</p></li><li><p>Open Library
    is an amazing project that''s part of the Internet Archive. It enables anyone
    to legally read books for free and has a full-text search of the millions of available
    books.</p></li></ul><h1 id="heading-problem">Problem</h1><p>I wanted to use <a
    target="_blank" href="http://followthatpage.com">followthatpage.com</a> to get
    notified when new books are added and the search results for a query change. Follow
    That Page only does a simple text diff and the original API call I was making
    <code>https://openlibrary.org/search.json?q=craigslist</code> contained the full
    JSON of all the books. Unfortunately, when anything about any of the books changed
    I would recieve a large diff.</p><p>I realized I could use the <code>fields</code>
    query param to only get the <code>title</code> and <code>key</code> (book id)
    of the works like this: <code>https://openlibrary.org/search.json?q=craigslist&amp;fields=title,key</code>.
    I also noticed that the books were sorted by relevance. Im not sure how relevance
    works but Ive seen search result order change when Ive added more information
    to books. So I decided to try sorting the books by their title following the search
    API docs. Unfortunately, the docs were a bit confusing and I didnt know why I
    couldnt sort by the key.</p><h1 id="heading-reaching-out">Reaching Out</h1><p>I
    popped into Open Librarys Slack and posed the question:</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/phlJV2xUMf7wEHxpRVlmdMBpisQjTuyEPJ1eyMkZKY7O6oaS9vOfzd-ptsciyDF8qwOf53YYGSGHDi43lX4G_vcJjvO41dJa0cX5okP_rPLVvh0h6EyTk9SGG017zKDaJXYm9AJ65Fil3Faj407v2AD-IAyAqLiInIL37cVm0lSyElzaFkz3RkHTLKzHbQ"
    alt="I''m struggling to understand the docs here.  How can I make this api call

    an Open Library maintainer, responded in a few minutes letting me know that we
    can only sort by a few allowed facets and asked why I wanted to sort by key.</p><p>I
    explained my idea to be notified of new works added for a certain search and he
    kindly pointed me to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/blob/abd73aa37ea27b4e7d70f521bfd1e30b7dc1dc6e/openlibrary/plugins/worksearch/schemes/works.py#L113-L132">the
    file</a> I would need to modify to do what I wanted. He confirmed I could follow
    the convention <code>random</code> was already used, which enables sorting in
    ascending or descending order.</p><p>Since Open Library''s dev wasn''t on my computer,
    I used the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gitpod.io/">GitPod</a> button
    (which <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/pull/5465">I
    set up</a> for Open Library a year ago) in the README and had a dev environment
    ready to go in minutes. I tweaked the file needed to sort by key and tested the
    API in GitPod. Everything looked good.</p><p>Im not that familiar with GitPods
    workflow for creating pull requests (PRs) so I just went to the file in GitHub
    and edited it via the web IDE.</p><p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/MnvPZyOQgh_QIxFlJsTnuPBLtbtaKfR9oVF-6xzhFVmRS0K5zpLa2bmTrhkd5Hgsi0FXUSJV7vZFWxkQqlxzcTnsQIoStNFa1tRBUggMcm1PwFCACpo8Xt762ehg-elOVRscbb05ioXKWqMC1Wel2sVTJaqJEqL8hTDxGKSVoN--0IHmfCVCtiDDquk1Wg"

    /></p><p>I recorded a demo video of my change working in GitPod for the PR. Then
    I filled out the rest of the details for <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/pull/7435">the
    PR</a> and posted it on Slack:</p><blockquote><p>Hey @Drini, not asking you to
    review now. But just letting you know I did open a PR and hope it can get in the
    queue to be checked out!</p></blockquote><p>Six minutes later the code was running
    on the test environment and promptly merged. After the next weekly deploy it will
    be in production. The docs are already updated!</p><h2 id="heading-timeline">Timeline</h2><ul><li><strong>9:50

  description: <p><a target="_blank" href="https://startupbus.com/">StartupBus</a>
    is a three-day <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">hackathon</a>
    to build a business with a team while riding a bus to Austin, Texas. On Wednesday,
    July 27, 2022 at 7AM I departed Tampa, Florida with seven other competitors and
    several great mentors and organizers.</p><h1 id="heading-why-did-i-do-this">Why
    did I do this?</h1><p>I enjoy hackathons, I like riding the bus, my partner Marley
    was hyped about going, Ive never been to Austin, and it just seemed like a fun,
    crazy thing to do. I didnt officially sign up until the day before, so it was
    a pretty last-minute decision.</p><p>The general order of events is:</p><ol><li>Come
    with a startup idea and pitch it</li><li>Form teams around the ideas that people
    are most interested in</li><li>Come up with a business plan</li><li>Start building
    a product</li><li>Pitch and refine based on feedback<ul><li>My team pitched at
    least 10 times in total</li></ul></li><li>Have fun with your teammates</li></ol><p><a
    target="_blank" href="https://startupbus.com/2022#buses-title">The buses</a> depart
    from different parts of the continent and each have their own journey. Aside from
    food and rest stops, the Florida bus stopped at <a target="_blank" href="https://innovate.research.ufl.edu/">UF
    Innovate</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.domistation.org/">Domi Station</a>,
    and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ideavillage.org/">The Idea Village</a>
    to hear from different entrepreneurs and pitch our ideas. These stops were inspiring
    and re-energizing. Shoutout to Evan Thacker for planning all these stops.</p><p>The
    energy in the room was palpable when we arrived in Austin for the pitch day and
    met the buspreneurs from the other buses. It helped that organizers were doing
    a great job running the music and getting everyone fired up with inspirational
    words.</p><h1 id="heading-how-did-the-pitches-go">How did the pitches go?</h1><p>I
    was extremely impressed by the quality of the pitches, despite the fact that we
    didnt know the exact format of pitches until moments before pitching began. We
    had a loose idea of the format for the first pitch (one minute to pitch) but were
    surprised to find out we had to pick one person on our team that would pitch,
    then there would be Q&amp;A, and then the judges would pick someone else on our
    team to give another one minute pitch. I did not like how they picked someone
    on each team to pitch and sometimes the person they picked wasnt comfortable pitching
    in English. I hope that language level was not a significant factor in the ultimate
    scoring.</p><p>After the qualifying round (one minute pitches), 10 of the 15 teams
    moved to the semi-finals. These were structured three minute pitches followed
    by two minutes of demos and then an off-stage technical assessment.</p><p>My team,
    Next Responder, placed fourth in the semi-finals. However, we chose not to move
    forward to the finals because we would have had to give up 1% of our company.
    Under the pressure of a five minute decision window, we didnt feel like there
    was clear enough value in the offer (mentorship, resources, and exposure) for
    our business, which is very B2B. However, Stayges, the other Florida bus team,
    accepted the offer and placed second overall!</p><h1 id="heading-conclusion">Conclusion</h1><p>Like
    any good challenge, there were some rough spots, but at the end of the day StartupBus
    was an awesome experience. The friendships, the travel, the challenge, and the
    creativity all blended together in a great way. I started with a bus full of strangers
    and ended with several buses full of friends.</p><p>Shout out to the people who
    made this an experience to remember:</p><ul><li>FL bus organizers and mentors
    (Joey, Mandy, Evan, Carey, and Josh)</li><li>FL bus participants (Chevy, Julie,
    Marley, Charlotte, Sasha, Justin, and VJ)</li><li>The people who broke bread,
    swapped stories, and went out of their way to spread good vibes (Gustrazo Reyes,
    Claudia Clo, Abril GaRa, Guillermo Vizcano, FanNy O'malley, Jackie Benitez, Yoali,
    Elena Itchel, Claudia Davila, and many more)</li></ul>

  description: '<p>These are my notes for <strong><em> <a target="_blank" href="https://openlibrary.org/books/OL26833660M/">Release
    It: Design and Deploy Production-Ready Software 2nd Edition</a> </em></strong>
    by Michael T. Nygard.</p><p>Im not sure how I found this book but it is likely
    from a search for SRE books.The fact that Ive been reading this book on and off
    for about 8 months says two things:</p><ol><li>I enjoyed the book enough to keep
    reading it - otherwise I would have stopped</li><li>It started to feel a little
    less relevant to my job as my SRE responsibilities ramped up</li></ol><p>Overall,
    the book was enjoyable to read and a good balance between information density
    and understandability. The case studies were quite enjoyable!</p><p>The main things
    I learned about were <strong>system design patterns, circuit breakers, bulkheads,
    backpressure, deceleration zones, leaky bucket, governors, multihoming, load balancing,
    and canary deploys.</strong></p><p>I made a list of all the books in the bibliography
    here: https://openlibrary.org/people/raybb/lists/OL200793L/</p><p>Some things
    from the book:</p><ul><li>The major dangers to your systems longevity are memory
    leaks and data growth. Both kinds of sludge will kill your system in production.
    Both are rarely caught during testing.</li><li>Just as auto engineers create crumple
    zonesareas designed to protect passengers by failing firstyou can create safe
    failure modes that contain the damage and protect the rest of the system.</li><li>Once
    established, a TCP connection can exist for days without a single packet being
    sent by either side.</li><li>Every integration point will eventually fail in some
    way, and you need to be prepared for that failure.</li><li>Partitioning servers
    with Bulkheads,, can prevent chain reactions from taking out the entire servicethough
    they wont help the callers of whichever partition does go down. Use Circuit Breaker
    on the calling side for that.</li><li>It would be wonderful if there was a way
    to keep things in the session (therefore in memory) when memory is plentiful but
    automatically be more frugal when memory is tight. Good news! Most language runtimes
    let you do exactly that with weak references.</li><li>some servers are handling
    more than a million concurrent connections</li><li>If youre dealing with vendor
    code, it may also be worth some time beating them up for a better client library.</li><li>Any
    special offer meant for a group of 10,000 users is guaranteed to attract millions.
    The community of networked bargain hunters can detect and share a reusable coupon
    code in milliseconds.</li><li>For service providers, use Handshaking and Backpressure
    to inform callers to throttle back on the requests. Also consider Bulkheads to
    reserve capacity for high-priority callers of critical services.</li><li>Build
    in deceleration zones to account for momentum. Suppose your control plane senses
    excess load every second, but it takes five minutes to start a virtual machine
    to handle the load. It must make sure not to start 300 virtual machines because
    the high load persists.</li><li>I like the Leaky Bucket pattern from Pattern Languages
    of Program Design 2 [VCK96]. Its a simple counter that you can increment every
    time you observe a fault. In the background, a thread or timer decrements the
    counter periodically (down to zero, of course.) If the count exceeds a threshold,
    then you know that faults are arriving quickly.Sisyphean - something that can
    never be completed</li><li>Log file rotation requires just a few minutes of configuration.</li><li>Every
    performance problem starts with a queue backing up somewhere.</li><li>A governor
    limits the speed of an engine. Slow things down to allow intervention</li><li>In
    development, the server can always call its language-specific version of getLocalHost,
    but on a multihomed machine, this simply returns the IP address associated with
    the servers internal hostname</li><li>Reject work as close to the edge as possible.
    The further it penetrates into your system, the more resources it ties up</li><li>the
    best way to tell if users are receiving a good experience is to measure it directly.
    This is known as real-user monitoring (or RUM, if you like).</li><li>the purpose
    of the canary deployment is to reject a bad build before it reaches the users.</li><li>The
    only safe way to handle file uploads is to treat the clients filename as an arbitrary
    string to store in a database field. Dont build a path from the filename in the
    request. Generate a unique, random key for the real filename and link it to the
    user-specified name in the database. That way, the names in the filesystem stay
    under your services control and dont include external input as any part.</li><li><strong>trickle,
    then batch</strong> - this is basically the pattern of putting an if in your code
    to manually change over something about data as it is accessed. Then you see it
    working slowly. Once youre confidence you can run a batch job to do the less frequently
    accessed data.</li><li>A good health check page reports the application version,
    the runtimes version, the hosts IP address, and the status of connection pools,
    caches, and circuit breakers.</li><li>Instead of creating a single system of record
    for any given concept, we should think in terms of federated zones of authority.</li><li>Highly
    efficient systems handle disruption badly. They tend to break all at once.</li><li>Also,
    as Charity Majors, CEO of Honeycomb.io says, If you have a wall full of green
    dashboards, that means your monitoring tools arent good enough. Theres always
    something weird going on.</li><li>You can make this more fun by calling it a zombie
    apocalypse simulation. Randomly select 50 percent of your people and tell them
    they are counted as zombies for the day. They are not required to eat any brains,
    but they are required to stay away from work and not respond to communication
    attempts.</li></ul><p>Why DNS round robin can be bad:</p><ul><li>Too much control
    in clients hands</li><li>DNS has no info about health of instances</li><li>Some
    clients control more info than others</li><li>global server load balancing (GSLB)
    server keeps track of the health and responsiveness of the pools.</li><li>GSLB
    can also apply weighted distribution and a host of load-balancing algorithms.
    These can be used as part of a disaster recovery strategy or even part of a rolling
    deployment process.</li><li>Use a different DNS provider still for your public
    status page.</li></ul><p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@rparmly?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Ross

    gotta have a good hook (aka logline) and title</li><li>High Concept - When it's
    easy to see what a movie is about from hook/title</li><li>You can, and sometimes
    must, near cliche but you always need a twist</li><li>Make the hero likeable</li><li>A
    good structure stops people from rewriting your script too much to take credits</li><li>Save
    the cat - Make the hero relatable</li><li>Double Mumbo Jumbo - Stick to one kind
    of magic per movie</li><li>Laying the pipe - telling the character backstory</li><li>Keep
    the press out - preserves the magic for the audience</li><li>If your hear is too
    neutral make the bad guy badder</li><li>Touch many emotions during you movie</li><li>Give
    minor characters a limp and eye patch to make them memorable</li></ul><p>Photo

  description: '<p>I''ve been a fan of the  <a target="_blank" href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/">Software
    Engineering Daily</a>  podcast for several years. When I learned that the creator,
    Jeff Meyerson, was releasing a book and it was just $0.99 on Kindle I couldn''t
    pass it up. That book was <a target="_blank" href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL24671877W/"><em>Move
    Fast: How Facebook Builds Software</em></a>.</p><p>In general, I liked the book.
    Short, to the point, and pretty well written. The book could do with one less
    mention of how HTML5 wasn''t enough for Facebook. Here are a few ideas from the
    book that I liked:</p><ul><li>"From its early days, Google has had more of an
    air of computer science, an academic bent that emphasizes proofs, correctness,
    and seriousness. Facebook engineers are self-deprecating hackers who just want
    to build cool stuff. Facebook engineers are comfortable with the fact that sometimes
    things break, and sometimes mistakes are made"</li><li>"Tom [a notable engineering
    manager at FB] believes that engineers should be spending 75 percent of their
    time at work on things that they are passionate about, because engineers do their
    best work when they are creatively satisfied."</li><li>Bootcamp is FB''s on boarding
    process. Fix real bugs on day one, find your team after several weeks.</li><li>"At
    Facebook, nobody forces an engineer to join a team. The managers who cant sell
    their projects end up with bad teams and have trouble succeeding. This causes
    bad managers to get weeded out quickly."</li><li>"A clique will form around an
    influencer engineer. Influencers can win over the hearts and minds of other engineers,
    single-handedly changing the technical direction of a company for better or worse."</li><li><strong>Push
    Karma</strong> - "a four-star rating system that tracked how responsible individual
    developers were in their management of software releases"</li><li>"Every engineering
    organization needs to decide how much time theyre going to spend cutting down
    the trees and how much time theyre going to spend sharpening their saws. Facebook
    had spent many years cutting down trees, and now it was time to sharpen their
    saws."</li><li>"When you work at Facebook, your work identity is kept seamlessly
    consistent across every tool, from video conferencing to code review. The uniformly
    integrated toolset makes the experience of being a Facebook employee totally unique.
    "</li><li>"Facebook invests so heavily in its infrastructure that most product
    engineers feel like they have effectively infinite resources. As they push the
    bounds of those resources, the infrastructure engineers respond by improving low-level
    abstractions such as compilers, databases, and networking protocols."</li></ul><p>Photo

    create solutions</p><h1 id="my-thoughts">My thoughts</h1><p>I liked the book a
    lot. It wasn''t perfectly written or organized but it really got me thinking about
    the role of markets. It''s interesting that the author advocates for them so heavily
    despite that they clearly don''t solve things on their own. We live in a world
    where the profit is seen as so important and it''s not clear how to change that.
    The author thinks problems can be fixed by social enterprises which are basically
    nonprofits that self fund. But it''s not super clear to me how we encourage people
    to start and run them. I guess that''s why he wrote this book. It''s also a bit
    of a hard pill to swallow to accept that maybe to have a big impact you shouldn''t
    be at a big org but rather solving things on a local level.</p><p>Photo by <a

  description: '<p>I recently finished reading <em>The Secret Life of Groceries: The
    Dark Miracle of the American Supermarket</em> by Benjamin Lorr (<a target="_blank"
    href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/253715/the-secret-life-of-groceries-by-benjamin-lorr/">link</a>).
    I learned about the book from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/08/books/review/the-secret-life-of-groceries-benjamin-lorr.html">a
    review</a> by Nick Summers published in The New York Times.</p><p>The book was
    a rollercoaster of stress, intrigue, and sadness. It is organized in six parts
    with stories following specific characters in different parts of the American
    supermarket supply chain.</p><p>What follows are notes and quotes organized by
    chapter.</p><h2 id="intro">Intro</h2><ul><li>"This book is about the grocery store.
    About the people who work there and the routes of supply that define it."</li><li>"appalling
    and perfectly hygienic and safeit is a fitting metaphor for the grocery business
    as whole."</li><li>"ten thousand minnows piled up in silver ribbons, left for
    days, as they waited to be transformed into the protein base of the aquaculture
    pyramid."</li><li>"We spend only 10 percent of our budget on food, compared to
    40 percent by our great-grandparents in 1900, and 30 percent by our grandparents
    in the 1950s."</li><li>"we now grapple with a series of problems entirely unprecedented
    in the history of humanity: of too much food, of using food to distribute ethical
    responsibility, of food as a proxy for control in our own increasingly detached
    lives."</li><li>"an item within the grocery matrix loses its identity as food
    and becomes product."</li></ul><h2 id="part-1-salad-days-at-trader-joes">Part
    1: Salad Days at Trader Joe''s</h2><p>In the old days of the general store, the
    wealthy would often be charged more, as items weren''t priced, but also given
    fresher meat and produce. In some stores a tab would be kept and families may
    only pay a few times a year after harvesting their crops.</p><p>Saunders, the
    founder of Piggly Wiggly, was inspired by the cafeteria. Cafeterias, which were
    new in the late 1800s, gave each customer a tray and had them walk down the line
    collecting food. This was the precursor to the supermarket. </p><ul><li>"One day,
    watching beady-eyed piglets charge a trough, Saunders decides the piggies are
    laughably similar to customers charging an overwhelmed clerk. In honor of all
    his piggy little customers, he names his new store the Piggly Wiggly."</li></ul><p>On
    the grocery industry: </p><ul><li>In 1937 the shopping cart was introduced by
    Sylvan Goldman.</li><li>"when Khrushchev toured Washington, D.C., in 1959, the
    supermarket brought a temporary dtente to the Cold War."</li><li>"legacy affairs:
    family businesses that follow the prototypically American progression from heartwarming,
    bootstrapping, backstabbing founder to eager scientific expansion in the immediate
    offspring to a sluggish, almost hostile complacency in the third and fourth generations."</li><li>"The
    word retail comes to us from the Middle French word retailler, meaning to cut
    into pieces, more etymologically related to the English word tailor than anything
    having to do with sales."</li><li>"it was suggested that if all owners agreed
    to longer hours la Greenthe chain could be called 7-Eleven."</li></ul><h3 id="the-story-of-joe-coulombe-and-trader-joes">The
    Story of Joe Coulombe and Trader Joe''s</h3><p>Joe is a very friendly guy and
    it is hard to know if he''s more of a calculating businessman or wholesome self-taught
    founder. He is a master of using the wink to create confidence.</p><p>Joe was
    hired by Rexall to figure out why Owl (a drugstore) was failing. He figured out
    7-Eleven was the cause and Rexall asked him to copy the chain and beat them. Joe
    decided he would beat them by paying as well as local unions and getting the best
    talent. The chain isn''t doing well and Joe buys Pronto using all his family savings
    and a loan from the bank. Pronto eventually becomes Trader Joe''s. The store had
    almost no turnover when Joe was running it. </p><ul><li>"Trader Joes, just like
    trader Joe, has perfected the ability to project integrity while simultaneously
    offering a very similar class of mass-produced goods that its competitors offer."</li><li>"you
    are the precise demographic Joe targeted way back thenthe overeducated, underpaid,
    and inquisitive; the customer who understands and cares for the world foremost
    by understanding and caring for themselves"<ul><li>"For Joe, private label needed
    to be an extension of the stores identity. It would allow him to create a parallel
    stock of items that appeared to exist outside the national homogeny, simultaneously,
    continuously produced, but more precisely targeting his demographic."</li></ul></li><li>"Trader
    Joes has the single highest sales per square foot of any retail grocery chain,
    basically doubling its nearest competitor, Whole Foods."</li><li>"He [Joe] picked
    up the grocery flag from merely large sizes and low prices and marched it forward,
    planting it back down firmly in our hearts."</li><li>Isn''t the most healthy<ul><li>Many
    of their best deals are on frozen or heavily processed foods</li><li>"Two different
    food safety experts I spoke with told me the unofficial FDA nickname for the chain
    is Recall Joes."</li></ul></li></ul><p>Some things that made Trader Joe''s Successful:
    </p><ul><li>Joe focuses on finding products with a high value to size ratio.</li><li>It
    was profitable to sell items in limited supply (like extra-large eggs). Other
    stores wouldn''t touch these because they were afraid to run out and disappoint
    customers.</li><li>Joe found a loophole in the regulations of wine pricing that
    nobody else noticed (pricing controls didn''t apply to imported wine) and was
    able to have the best deal on wine.</li></ul><p>Trader Joe''s couldn''t compete
    with others on peanut butter, so they decided to make almond butter and basically
    invented it as a consumer product.</p><p>Theo Albrecht of Albrecht Discount (aka
    ALDI) decided to buy Trader Joe''s. Joe sold it on the condition that he would
    stay as CEO and the store wouldn''t be changed too much. Tension built and before
    long Joe resigned. Joe now talks about the sale with a nervous sadness.</p><h2
    id="part-2-distribution-of-responsibility">Part 2: Distribution of Responsibility</h2><h3
    id="lynne-a-truck-driver">Lynne, a truck driver</h3><ul><li>"''I recommend you
    get yourself a Gatorade bottle.'' She looks me up and down. ''Wide mouth for you.''
    I dont believe that I react to this. ''Stop looking pale. Im just fucking with
    you. Nothing in those pants looks like youre a wide mouth anything.''"</li><li>"If
    I [Lynne] ever lost my CDL for anything, theyd have to put me in the ground. This
    job is misery, but its the only thing in the world for me."</li><li>"At first
    this seems like an interviewers dream. A subject overflowing with commentary,
    dripping with color."</li><li>"She [Lynne] simply doesnt recognize or care about
    the social cues I am sending outor actually combative, using words as a weapon."</li><li>"I
    [the author] know things have taken a dark turn when I consider getting earplugs
    for hanging around a woman I am ostensibly here to interview."</li><li>"Lynne
    estimates she grossed $200,000 last yearthat is a rough calculation based on miles
    drivenbut that she took home less than $17,000."</li><li>"I [Lynne] know there
    is a light at the end of the tunnel. Because I am locked into this contract and
    I cant afford to believe anything else."</li><li>"Lynne also tells me that at
    a truck stop she never makes eye contact with a man."</li><li>"[when Lynne reported
    sexual harassment] the company was like ''Maybe you misconstrued it,''"</li><li>Lynne
    has so many fees come out of her paycheck that she often only gets the minimum
    paycheck of $100, just enough to keep her surviving off the cheapest food available.</li><li>She
    hasn''t been home to see her family in many months because they won''t let her
    take routes that go that way. The author theorizes that this is to help keep the
    truckers from quitting when they get a taste of home.</li></ul><h3 id="the-industry">The
    Industry</h3><ul><li>People see ads to work as a well-paid trucker. They''ll get
    a one way ticket to the training and hotel paid for.<ul><li>Once they get there
    they are promised a great job if they just sign a contract for training that you
    can pay for later, $3,000 - $8,000.</li><li>After they finish the training there
    are often no "jobs" available but they are offered to be independent contractors
    and get their own trucks via lease-to-own programs.</li><li>"Lease-to-own programs
    in OTR trucking seem like both [very difficult and designed to fail] to me."</li><li>These
    desperate people sign up and now have huge loans they have to pay and are at the
    mercy of the company to assign them jobs. These jobs are often extremely poorly
    paid and have nearly impossible deadlines.</li><li>After all the fees their paychecks
    often come out to almost nothing but they have a guaranteed minimum pay of ~$100,
    just enough to feed themselves and keep driving.</li></ul></li><li>"Jimmy Hoffa
    was a teamster first and foremost, and the strong, if corrupt, union he led was
    able to wrest a middle-class salary with benefits from that cohort."</li><li>"From
    the golden 70s, the trucker suddenly found himself in the red and green 80s, the
    colors of the now essential methamphetamines drivers gobbled by the handful"</li><li>"Your
    possessions are on top of each other [a trucker and their co-driver], your needs
    are on top of each other, your sexual desires and rage and annoying quirks are
    on top of each other."</li><li>"That fresh apple you bite into has typically been
    sitting in dormancy for close to a year."<ul><li>"The core of this control [of
    produce] comes from regulating ethylene, a gaseous plant hormone that causes ripening
    and color development. Within the right conditions, suppressing ethylene keeps
    fruit in a suspended state of development."</li></ul></li><li>"Seeing almost any
    product in bulk is debasing."</li></ul><h3 id="part-3-self-realization-through-snacks">Part
    3: Self-Realization Through Snacks</h3><ul><li>"the twin attributes of successful
    specialty: mystery and superiority."</li><li>"[people] stand up in sudden inspiration
    to snap a photo of a PowerPoint slide"<ul><li>I relate to the author''s confusion
    of people taking photos of seemingly useless slides.</li></ul></li><li>"<a target="_blank"
    href="https://www.slawsa.com/">Slawsa</a> is as intuitive as it is baffling."</li><li>"Perhaps
    she is good-natured without being good-humored. Perhaps she is good-humored without
    having a good sense of humor. ... It is a laughter at her own foibles, where you
    are kind of worried for her"</li><li>"[many grocery stores have] a slotting fee,
    which is a pure cash-for-placement exchange.""</li></ul><h2 id="part-4-the-retail-experience">Part
    4: The Retail Experience</h2><p>Lorr (the author) got a job at Whole Foods to
    get the inside scoop.</p><ul><li>New employees must complete a twelve-hour orientation
    about the mission and philosophy of Whole Foods.<ul><li>"concussive effect of
    repetitive dull content"</li><li>"Passing the probation vote [to be hired at Whole
    foods] requires a two-thirds majority in which each team member fills out a skills
    sheet anonymously ranking our abilities."</li><li>"We [Whole Foods employees]
    are told to apologize for any and every mistake, especially if it isnt our fault,
    unless, of course, the customer is complaining about injury or food-borne illness"</li><li>"Andy
    gives us a secret phrase to use whenever we are stumped: Sounds important. It
    can be deployed almost universally to respond to questions we dont fully understand,
    hectoring we dont necessarily deserve, demands for advice we dont particularly
    have"</li><li>"Mr. Green is the Orwellian name for the Whole Foods internal security
    team"</li></ul></li><li>"Human Capital Management, or just-in-time scheduling"<ul><li>"somewhere
    in the last ten years, just-in-time manufacturing morphed into just-in-time scheduling."</li><li>"He

    schedule."</li><li>"Another [study] found that 60 percent of retail workers said
    that they needed to be available to fulfill every work schedule that might be
    assigned in a given week"</li><li>"There are professions where we expect people
    to be on calldoctors, first respondersbut they are compensated for that both financially
    and in civic respect"</li></ul></li><li>"organic does not mean healthier, but
    rather is an option to pay extra to limit the externalities of production"</li><li>"we
    pluck melons just on the verge of rot and take them into the back room, where
    a woman who speaks no English stands all day carving them up into chunks and packing
    endless grab-n-go containers."</li></ul><h2 id="part-5-theater-of-retail">Part
    5: Theater of Retail</h2><ul><li>"I kept thinking of the medieval practice of
    simony, where the wealthy could pay money to be released from their sins."</li><li>"Government
    regulation of our food is as spotty as a fourteen-year-old boys first beard"</li><li>"These
    audits rarely occur unannounced, instead unfolding with all the spontaneity of
    a doctors appointment. ... [because] People dont hire you to blow up their deals."</li><li>"It
    [the pig farm] was not filthy, nor a hellscape. It was instead an intensely alien,
    highly functional place for animals to live a sad, short life before they were
    set to die."</li><li>"Anthropologist Daniel Miller studied purchasing decisions
    of Britons and Trinidadians and came to the conclusion that most people didnt
    even know whether they liked something until after they shared it with others."</li></ul><h2
    id="part-6-bottom-of-the-commodity-chain">Part 6: Bottom of the Commodity Chain</h2><h3
    id="the-horrors-of-shrimp">The horrors of shrimp</h3><p>Tun-Lin is a man from
    Myanmar who makes his way to Thailand only to be sold into slave labor on a shrimp
    boat. He left Myanmar not even knowing what a factory was, only that if you work
    hard you can make good money. He watched his best friend die on a shrimp boat
    and then get kicked over the side. After five years of slave labor on the boat
    he simply asks the captain if he can leave and is set free. This chapter goes
    into much more gruesome detail about what life was like aboard the slave ship.</p><p>Also:</p><ul><li>"NGOs
    estimate 17 to 60 percent of Thai shrimp includes slave labor like Tun-Lin in
    its supply chain"</li><li>"This is called transshipment at sea. It saves fuel
    for the larger refrigerated fishing vessels, and it allows some boats to stay
    out almost indefinitely. Resupplied by others, they turn into floating prisons
    for trafficked workers."</li><li>"Rule number one when hiring people is you do
    not hire locals. They will want to go home. They will have families. You want
    someone who will live here twenty-four"</li><li>"Peeling shrimp is delicate labor,
    and despite all advances in technology, nothing can yet do the work better than
    small, nimble fingers."</li><li>"The [commodity] word comes to us etymologically
    from the French commodit, meaning convenience"</li><li>"thirty years ago, fresh
    shrimp epitomized class. They cost more than steak"</li><li>"since 1980 prices
    [of shrimp] have fallen while production has increased some 3,000 percent."</li><li>"It
    turns out for as of yet biologically unexplained reasons, a female shrimp who
    loses a single eyeball gets fast-tracked through puberty"</li><li>"A cycle of
    spectacular growth, overnight riches, and then sudden collapse came to define
    the Asian shrimp industry."</li><li>"[dropping an unpopular supplier or food is]

    ugly things"</li></ul><h2 id="afterword">Afterword</h2><ul><li>The Whole Foods
